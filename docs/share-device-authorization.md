# Share-first device authorization

`tc share publish` can bootstrap a new remote or headless user without requiring
`tc init` or a pre-existing TinyCloud profile. The CLI creates an Ed25519
session key locally, sends only its public JWK and DID to OpenKey, prints a
verification URL and short user code, and polls until the user approves.

The same behavior is available explicitly:

```bash
tc auth login --device
tc enable share
```

Interactive `tc auth login` continues to use the loopback browser callback.
Non-interactive login prefers device authorization. `--paste` remains an
explicit manual fallback and is never selected implicitly.

The device request is limited to `tinycloud.capabilities/read` for the
`applications` space. That capability can request the existing body-bound,
one-shot Node Share upload attestation; it does not confer general KV/SQL
authority and does not create a Share space. OpenKey binds the result to the
CLI session DID/public key, Node and Share origins, requested permissions, and
the approved expiry. The default delegation lifetime is 30 days. Share object
retention remains seven days.

The CLI holds a 256-bit device secret, an independent PKCE verifier, and an
ephemeral P-256 relay decryption key. OpenKey stores only the secret/verifier
hashes, rate-limits creation and polling, and releases each result once. The
browser encrypts the approved delegation directly to the CLI relay public key,
so the device relay receives ciphertext rather than a plaintext delegation. No
private CLI key is sent to OpenKey or the Share registry.

## Hermetic public smoke

Build the CLI, then run the cross-repository smoke from the OpenKey checkout:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/cli build
bun ../openkey/scripts/share-device-auth-smoke.ts --cli "$PWD/packages/cli/dist/index.js"
```

The harness invokes the public `tc share publish report.md` entry point against
real local HTTP protocol services and a cryptographically valid,
end-to-end-encrypted relay result. It asserts the device prompt, persisted
session, two attested uploads, seven-day retention, and complete Share URL. It
does not automate the separate human passkey/browser approval journey.
