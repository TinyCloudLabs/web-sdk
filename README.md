## Features

- **Web3 Authentication** - Sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE) using your wallet
- **Space Management** - Create and manage user-owned data spaces
- **KV Storage** - Content-addressed key-value store scoped to user spaces
- **Delegation System** - Cryptographic capability chains for fine-grained access control
- **Sharing** - Portable delegation bundles for cross-user data sharing
- **Protocol Version Check** - Automatic SDK-node compatibility verification during sign-in
- **Wallet Integration** - Seamless connection with popular Ethereum wallets (browser SDK)
- **Server Support** - Node.js SDK for server-side delegation chains and automation
- **Type Safety** - Written in TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions

## Quick Start

### Browser SDK

```bash
npm install @tinycloudlabs/web-sdk
```

```typescript
import { TinyCloudWeb } from '@tinycloudlabs/web-sdk';

const tc = new TinyCloudWeb();
await tc.signIn();

// KV storage
await tc.kv.put('myKey', { hello: 'world' });
const result = await tc.kv.get('myKey');
```

### Node.js SDK

```bash
npm install @tinycloudlabs/node-sdk
```

```typescript
import { TinyCloudNode } from '@tinycloudlabs/node-sdk';

const tc = new TinyCloudNode({
  privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
  domain: 'api.myapp.com',
});

await tc.signIn();

// KV storage
await tc.kv.put('myKey', { hello: 'world' });
const result = await tc.kv.get('myKey');

// Delegations
const delegation = await tc.createDelegation({
  delegateDID: 'did:pkh:eip155:1:0x...',
  abilities: ['tinycloud.kv/get', 'tinycloud.kv/put'],
});
```

## Inspiration

The TinyCloud Web SDK is the spiritual successor to the [SSX SDK](https://github.com/spruceid/ssx). SSX was an open source project built at SpruceID, made to make it easier to build apps with Sign in with Ethereum. While SSX saw limited adoption, it was a great project that pioneered the use of Ethereum for authentication and authorization. TinyCloud Web takes some of its architectural shape from SSX, but is built to be a modern SDK for building applications with TinyCloud.
