# TinyCloud SDK

The TinyCloud SDK is a set of tools and utilities to help you build your app with TinyCloud.

## Inspiration

The TinyCloud SDK is the spiritual successor to the [SSX SDK](https://github.com/spruceid/ssx). SSX was an open source project built at SpruceID, made to make it easier to build apps with Sign in with Ethereum. While SSX saw limited adoption, it was a great project that pioneered the use of Ethereum for authentication and authorization. TinyCloud is takes some of it's architectural shape from SSX, but is built from the ground up to be a modern SDK for building apps with TinyCloud.
