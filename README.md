## Inspiration

The TinyCloud Web SDK is the spiritual successor to the [SSX SDK](https://github.com/spruceid/ssx). SSX was an open source project built at SpruceID, made to make it easier to build apps with Sign in with Ethereum. While SSX saw limited adoption, it was a great project that pioneered the use of Ethereum for authentication and authorization. TinyCloud Web takes some of its architectural shape from SSX, but is built to be a modern SDK for building applications with TinyCloud.
