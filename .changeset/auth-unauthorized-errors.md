Add `AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED` error code and 401 handling across all services. When the server returns 401 with "Unauthorized Action: {resource} / {ability}", the SDK now parses the response and returns a structured `AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED` error with `requiredAction` and `resource` in meta. Affects KV, SQL, and DuckDB services.
