- a6dd764: Expose verified share metadata on the first-class `share.receive()` result so host applications can render without re-parsing the share.

## 3.0.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

## 3.0.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- 4b60562: Add the OAuth `tinycloud:manage-key` canonical-key signer and the public web
  SDK session helper. The signer preserves the exact SIWE/ReCap bytes, uses a
  cookie-free client token only, validates the canonical identity and signature,
  and exposes terminal OAuth policy errors.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [4b60562]
  - @tinycloud/sdk-core@3.0.0-beta.1
  - @tinycloud/node-sdk@3.0.0-beta.1

## 3.0.0-beta.0

### Major Changes

- 5770e70: TC-292 removes the standalone chain/RPC layer and signs through the connected
  wallet's raw EIP-1193 provider. `TinyCloudWeb.provider` is now the raw
  EIP-1193 provider rather than an ethers-compatible Web3 provider facade; the
  standalone RPC provider factory and its network URL fallback are removed.
  ENS resolution remains available through the connected wallet provider.

### Patch Changes

- ce34dc1: Add the SDK-owned `<tinycloud-credential-acquisition>` element and controller
  for first-party inline credential issuance. The Web SDK now renders the
  descriptor-driven ceremony inside the caller's document, reuses the active
  TinyCloud/OpenKey session for holder binding, and keeps OpenCredentials
  transport, verification, durable storage, and proof submission SDK-owned.
  Existing redirect and headless credential-acquisition behavior is unchanged.

  - @tinycloud/sdk-core@3.0.0-beta.0
  - @tinycloud/node-sdk@3.0.0-beta.0

## 2.11.0

### Minor Changes

- b38dd12: Add versioned OpenKey authorization protocol (v1) types and consumer wiring.
  - `sdk-core` exports `TinyCloudAuthorizationRequestV1`, `TinyCloudAuthorizationResultV1`, `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1`, `validateAuthorizationResultV1`, `isPlausibleOpenKeyActionId`, `OPENKEY_ACTION_ID_SEPARATOR`.
  - `sdk-core` also exports narrowing-verification helpers `extractImmutableSiweFields`, `diffImmutableSiweFields`, `extractRecapAttenuations`, `unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` (with `ImmutableSiweFields` and `RecapAttenuation` types) so consumers can prove that a widget-signed SIWE is a strict narrowing of the SDK's original prepared SIWE.
  - `node-sdk` adds `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult()` which completes the session with the exact `signedMessage` the OpenKey widget returned (not the caller's original prepared SIWE). Its `prepared` argument now REQUIRES `siwe` (the SDK-generated reference SIWE). Validates that the signature verifies against the returned bytes, that the recovered signer matches the local signer, that every immutable SIWE header field (domain, address, URI, version, chainId, nonce, issuedAt) is preserved byte-for-byte, that the ReCap capability set is a subset of the original request, and that `selectedActionKeys` are covered by that set. Note: `statement` handling was refined in `sol-final-continuation-fixes.md` — earlier drafts of this changeset incorrectly implied statement drift was always allowed; the delivered rule is that statement is byte-immutable for plain SIWEs and validated via the ReCap subset check for ReCap-bearing SIWEs.
  - `cli` browser-auth advertises `protocolVersion=1` on the /delegate URL, validates every callback payload before persisting (including structural checks on the optional `permissions[]` array), and (when the response includes effective `permissions`) refuses any grant that broadens the requested set.
  - `sdk-core.unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` now enforces EXACT MULTISET EQUALITY on the caveat list for every surviving (resource, ability) pair. Removing an entire ability or resource from the child is still permitted (that is genuine narrowing), but for any (resource, ability) that survives, the child's caveat list must equal the parent's caveat list as a multiset — i.e. same set of canonicalized caveat objects with the SAME duplicate counts. Concretely: (a) adding a caveat not present in the parent is rejected, (b) removing an alternative from a non-empty parent caveat list is rejected (removing all caveats to broaden from "restricted" to "unrestricted" is the special case of this), (c) replacing a caveat with a different one is rejected, (d) changing the number of times a duplicated caveat appears is rejected, and (e) the empty-parent case requires the child to also be empty on that ability (both sides carry zero caveats — neither imposes a restriction). Order within a caveat object's own keys is normalized via canonical JSON serialization before counting, so key reordering inside a single caveat is not itself a difference; only differences in the multiset of caveat objects matter.
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` now enforces stricter selectedActionKeys/permissions consistency: `selectedActionKeys` must cover every non-required capability in `signedMessage`; every returned `permissions` entry action must appear in `signedMessage`; broader `permissions` entries are rejected; empty `permissions[]` with a capability-bearing SIWE is rejected; duplicate `selectedActionKeys` entries are rejected; and the resource-substring fallback used to resolve permission entries has been replaced with a canonical two-form resolver (space or space+path) that fails on ambiguity.
  - `node-sdk` adds `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKey(authorizeFn, opts)` — the production entry point that wires `prepareSessionForSigning` → OpenKey `authorizeTinyCloud()` → `signInWithOpenKeyResult` into one call. Callers provide a thin `authorizeFn` bridge to the OpenKey SDK; the node-sdk enforces every subset/immutable-field invariant before creating any session state.
  - `cli.parseDelegationExpiryField` numeric-seconds test fixture corrected (was passing `4_071_849_600` = Jan 11 2099, but expected Jan 1 2099 = `4_070_908_800`).
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` REJECTS legacy two-part `resource\0action` selectedActionKeys — Sol continuation contract requires the CANONICAL four-part `service\0space\0path\0ability` shape. The prior suffix-match fallback silently accepted IDs that did not carry a validated service namespace; four-part canonical IDs are the only accepted format.
  - `node-sdk` adds `wireOpenKeyAuthorize(openkey)` — a production adapter that translates any structurally-OpenKey object (typically `@openkey/sdk`'s `OpenKey` instance) into the `authorizeFn` callback `signInWithOpenKey` expects. The bridge does not fabricate protocol fields — every value flows through unchanged, and wire drift (missing `signedMessage`, unsupported `protocolVersion`, malformed selection) throws at the boundary. Enables real production consumers to wire OpenKey into `NodeUserAuthorization` without either package taking a direct build dependency on the other.

- b5d2e10: Stop browser sign-in hanging forever on an invisible space-creation dialog (TC-362).

  `ModalSpaceCreationHandler.confirmSpaceCreation` returned a promise that only ever
  settled on a click inside a shadow-DOM `<tinycloud-space-modal>`. When that dialog
  was not reachable — for example hidden behind an app's own full-screen "Connecting…"
  overlay — `ensureSpaceExists` awaited it forever and sign-in looked permanently stuck,
  with nothing in the light DOM to explain why.
  - The wait is now bounded (default 2 minutes, configurable via the new
    `TinyCloudWeb` config option `spaceCreationTimeoutMs` or
    `new ModalSpaceCreationHandler({ timeoutMs })`; `0` restores the unbounded wait).
    On expiry the handler closes the dialog and rejects with a `SpaceCreationTimeoutError`
    whose message names the element, the likely cause, and the three ways out.
  - **Behaviour change:** `autoCreateSpace` is now honoured in the browser. `TinyCloudWeb`
    used to install the modal handler unconditionally, and node-sdk gives an explicit
    handler precedence over `autoCreateSpace`, so the option was dead config in the browser.
    `autoCreateSpace: true` now creates the space with no dialog, `autoCreateSpace: false`
    skips creation entirely, and leaving it unset keeps today's modal confirmation.
    An explicit `spaceCreationHandler` still wins over both.
  - While the SDK is blocked on the user it sets
    `data-tinycloud-awaiting-user-input="space-creation"` on `<html>`, fires
    `tinycloud:awaiting-user-input` / `tinycloud:awaiting-user-input-resolved` on `window`,
    and logs an explanatory warning — so a stuck sign-in is diagnosable from outside
    the shadow root. New helper `pendingUserInputKind()` reports the same state.
  - The owner-policy sharing path signs mid-compose by re-opening the wallet/OpenKey
    signing surface. An unanswered or cancelled prompt there used to surface the same
    `PERMISSION_DENIED` "the active session ReCap does not authorize this sharing
    delegation" message as a genuine HTTP 403. It is now reported as `TIMEOUT` or
    `ABORTED` with a message that says what to do, and the underlying error is kept
    as `cause`.

- f0842d8: TC-373: fix two blockers found in review of the batched account-bootstrap seed-spaces write.
  - `KVService.batchPut` now attaches structured metadata (`requestMayHaveDispatched`, and on the two unconfirmed-2xx response paths, `responseReceived` / `status` / `outcome: "batch-unconfirmed"`) to `NETWORK_ERROR`/`TIMEOUT` failures instead of leaving them unclassified. No new `ErrorCodes` member is added — the ambiguity is carried entirely in `meta` to avoid widening the exported `ErrorCode` union.
  - `AccountService.spaces.registerBatch`'s internal ambiguous-failure classifier is now a strict allow-list (previously a deny-list that defaulted to "retry", so deterministic failures like 400/409/422, `INVALID_INPUT`, and 501/505 triggered five pointless per-space reconcile puts). `registerBatch` now returns `RegisterBatchSuccess` (`{ spaces, recoveredFromBatchError? }`) instead of a bare array, so a batch write that recovers via per-space reconciliation is visible on the success payload, not only via `console.warn`.
  - `TinyCloudNode.bootstrapStatus` gains an optional `warnings?: BootstrapWarning[]` field: bootstrap that completes via a recovered ambiguous write is now programmatically distinguishable from a clean run (both were previously `{ skipped: false }`).

  Both changes are additive; nothing published is broken.

- d894c57: TC-393: recover incomplete account bootstrap with a durable account-space
  completion marker, canonical account registry read/create-update/list, delegation,
  capabilities-read, marker, and SQL coverage, and an idempotent
  repair pass. One-shot CoordinationOS OpenKey sessions now explicitly disable
  client-side bootstrap.

### Patch Changes

- 746cb02: Stop implicitly probing `127.0.0.1` during TinyCloud host discovery. Loopback
  discovery now requires an explicit `localNodeUrl`, while configured and
  registry-discovered `*.local.tinycloud.link` nodes continue to work.
- 8489db8: Add a one-shot OpenKey session helper. Keep callback and signing semantics unchanged. Provide a deterministic vendorable ESM output.
- d1d675b: Allow owner delegations to sign exact permissions across TinyCloud services, including the owner encryption network's decrypt capability, while preserving the legacy single-resource API.
- 44ecf56: Release the exact-head session invocation APIs and canonical recipient-DID policy support used by Share.
- 68faad4: Reduce published SDK bundle and WASM artifact sizes by enabling safe package tree-shaking, using ES2020 output, removing release source maps, and optimizing WASM for size. `@tinycloud/sdk-services` keeps its published root entries in the `sideEffects` allowlist because they install debug globals at module scope.

  The corrected `@tinycloud/web-sdk` dry-run pack contains 52 files and no `.map` files. `packages/web-sdk/tests/signInManifestRestore.test.ts` passed 8/8 with mocked auth under Bun. Live-wallet E2E was not run.

- 2173048: Allow the CoordinationOS OpenKey session helper to grant its exact private invite-code record alongside the required canary record.
- cc75957: Sol continuation v2: add a production-shape narrowed-SIWE round-trip test
  to `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKey.e2e.test.ts` that exercises
  the client's `signInWithOpenKeyResult` acceptance path against the exact
  wire shape the OpenKey `/authorize-sign` route emits when a user narrows
  capabilities in the widget. The test asserts:
  - The narrowed `signedMessage` decodes to the expected reduced ability
    set (kv/put removed, kv/get + capabilities/read retained).
  - The ReCap-derived statement in `signedMessage` no longer mentions the
    removed abilities.
  - The signature verifies against `signedMessage`.
  - Every canonical four-part `selectedActionKeys` entry resolves to a
    real (resource, ability) pair.
  - Every `permissions` entry has non-empty actions and matches a resource
    in the signed ReCap.

  This complements the matching OpenKey-side test in
  `apps/api/src/__tests__/delegate-authorize-sign-nodeauth-e2e.test.ts`
  which invokes the actual Hono router with the same production-shape
  SIWE. Together the two tests cover the wire boundary from both sides
  using real production code paths.

- e525137: Address Sol continuation-review rejection blockers on the OpenKey
  authorization consolidation.
  - `sdk-core.ImmutableSiweFields` now covers the full immutable header set:
    `expirationTime`, `notBefore`, `requestId`, `statement`, and
    `nonRecapResources`. `extractImmutableSiweFields` parses them and
    `diffImmutableSiweFields` includes them so a widget swapping any
    of these fields fails the SDK's byte-for-byte immutable check.
  - `sdk-core.unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` now enforces STRICT normalized
    caveat-multiset equality. Dropping alternatives from a disjunction,
    adding restrictions to an unrestricted parent, and any lexical caveat
    change all reject. Formal attenuation may relax this later.
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` requires the returned `permissions`
    array to equal the signed authority for EVERY resource/action pair,
    including structurally-required capabilities (e.g.
    `tinycloud.capabilities/read`). Missing entries and extras both fail
    hard (was: only non-required coverage was required).
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKey` accepts an optional `openkeyKeyId` option
    and forwards it to the `authorizeFn` bridge so callers can pin the
    OpenKey key ID used by the widget.
  - `cli.auth request --grant` reports EFFECTIVE grants (from the signed
    delegation) rather than the originally-requested set — the previous
    behaviour over-reported authority when the user narrowed the request
    in the OpenKey UI. Applies to both OpenKey-backed and local-key flows.
  - `node-sdk` production TypeScript build no longer includes test sources
    or test-support modules, so `tsc --noEmit -p packages/node-sdk/tsconfig.json`
    now exits 0.
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKey` resolves the actual TinyCloud activation host
    before preparing or sending the OpenKey authorization request. A per-call
    host override is installed as the session host, so the host bound into the
    OpenKey context and the host later used for activation cannot diverge.

- ba9c983: Merge-readiness consolidation for the OpenKey authorization protocol.

  The manifest digest now uses a shared sorted-key canonical JSON protocol with
  OpenKey, so whitespace and object-key order in a published well-known manifest
  do not break origin binding. The mandatory cross-repository CI job is pinned to
  the immutable compatible OpenKey revision containing the real Hono harness.

  `sdk-core` (`packages/sdk-core/src/authorization/openkey-protocol.ts`):
  - Extend `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1` with an optional
    `manifests: Array<{ name?: string; appId?: string; payload?: Record<string, unknown> }>`
    field. Display-only. The receiving OpenKey side size-bounds and
    validates the envelope before use; envelopes carrying trust/verification
    override keys are dropped. Manifests never expand authority — the
    ReCap payload remains the sole gate.
  - Clarify in JSDoc that `reason` is caller-supplied context and
    rendered as "reason provided by caller" in the review UI unless a
    cryptographic manifest signature (or origin-bind) confirms it.

  `node-sdk` (`packages/node-sdk/src/authorization/NodeUserAuthorization.ts`):
  - `signInWithOpenKey` now builds a `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1`
    from `this._manifest` (when set) and forwards it to the caller's
    `authorizeFn`. The envelope carries `displayName`, `reason`
    (optional), `manifestId`, a canonical SHA-256 `manifestDigest` over
    the primary manifest, and the full `manifests[]` payload array.
    Callers can pass a `reason` string in `options` — rendered as
    caller-supplied, never as verified.
  - New `options.reason?: string` parameter for
    `signInWithOpenKey(authorizeFn, options)`.
  - Internal helpers `canonicalStringify` + `canonicalSha256Hex` produce
    a stable digest that the OpenKey server can match against the
    fetched `.well-known/openkey-manifest.json` bytes. Apps that want
    origin-binding MUST publish the same JSON at the well-known path.
  - The presentation envelope is forwarded VERBATIM through the
    `OpenKeyBridgeInput` shape; the bridge does not fabricate any
    fields.

  `node-sdk` (`packages/node-sdk/src/authorization/openKeyBridge.ts`):
  - Extend `OpenKeyAuthorizeTinyCloud.authorizeTinyCloud()` request
    shape and `OpenKeyBridgeInput` with the optional `presentation`
    envelope. `wireOpenKeyAuthorize` forwards it to the underlying
    OpenKey SDK unchanged.

  CI (`.github/workflows/authority-tests.yml`):
  - The isolated `authority` job now sets `OPENKEY_HARNESS_OPTIONAL: "1"`
    so the cross-repo Hono contract test skips gracefully when no
    sibling OpenKey developer worktree is present. Callers can no
    longer break the js-sdk CI merely by not having OpenKey checked out
    alongside.
  - New required `cross-repo-contract` job checks out BOTH js-sdk and
    OpenKey (from `openkey-so/openkey@main`) at compatible revisions,
    builds js-sdk's authority packages, and runs the cross-repo Hono
    contract test with `OPENKEY_WORKTREE` and `OPENKEY_RUN_HARNESS=1`
    set. The dedicated job means the real Hono contract remains
    MANDATORY — the escape hatch in the isolated job only prevents
    incidental breakage.

  Cross-repo Hono test:
  - `NodeUserAuthorization.crossRepoHono.e2e.test.ts` now spawns the
    OpenKey harness with `OPENKEY_RUN_HARNESS=1` set in the child
    environment. The harness carries a defence-in-depth guard that
    refuses to boot without that variable, so this cross-repo contract
    test is the only path that spins it up (a broad `bun test` walk in
    the OpenKey repo, or an accidental double-spawn, cannot leak a
    stuck Hono process on the port).

  Documentation-only changeset for `@tinycloud/web-sdk` and
  `@tinycloud/sdk-services`; those packages export types re-exported
  from `sdk-core`, so the envelope shape change flows through
  transitively.

## 2.11.0-beta.10

### Minor Changes

- b38dd12: Add versioned OpenKey authorization protocol (v1) types and consumer wiring.
  - `sdk-core` exports `TinyCloudAuthorizationRequestV1`, `TinyCloudAuthorizationResultV1`, `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1`, `validateAuthorizationResultV1`, `isPlausibleOpenKeyActionId`, `OPENKEY_ACTION_ID_SEPARATOR`.
  - `sdk-core` also exports narrowing-verification helpers `extractImmutableSiweFields`, `diffImmutableSiweFields`, `extractRecapAttenuations`, `unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` (with `ImmutableSiweFields` and `RecapAttenuation` types) so consumers can prove that a widget-signed SIWE is a strict narrowing of the SDK's original prepared SIWE.
  - `node-sdk` adds `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult()` which completes the session with the exact `signedMessage` the OpenKey widget returned (not the caller's original prepared SIWE). Its `prepared` argument now REQUIRES `siwe` (the SDK-generated reference SIWE). Validates that the signature verifies against the returned bytes, that the recovered signer matches the local signer, that every immutable SIWE header field (domain, address, URI, version, chainId, nonce, issuedAt) is preserved byte-for-byte, that the ReCap capability set is a subset of the original request, and that `selectedActionKeys` are covered by that set. Note: `statement` handling was refined in `sol-final-continuation-fixes.md` — earlier drafts of this changeset incorrectly implied statement drift was always allowed; the delivered rule is that statement is byte-immutable for plain SIWEs and validated via the ReCap subset check for ReCap-bearing SIWEs.
  - `cli` browser-auth advertises `protocolVersion=1` on the /delegate URL, validates every callback payload before persisting (including structural checks on the optional `permissions[]` array), and (when the response includes effective `permissions`) refuses any grant that broadens the requested set.
  - `sdk-core.unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` now enforces EXACT MULTISET EQUALITY on the caveat list for every surviving (resource, ability) pair. Removing an entire ability or resource from the child is still permitted (that is genuine narrowing), but for any (resource, ability) that survives, the child's caveat list must equal the parent's caveat list as a multiset — i.e. same set of canonicalized caveat objects with the SAME duplicate counts. Concretely: (a) adding a caveat not present in the parent is rejected, (b) removing an alternative from a non-empty parent caveat list is rejected (removing all caveats to broaden from "restricted" to "unrestricted" is the special case of this), (c) replacing a caveat with a different one is rejected, (d) changing the number of times a duplicated caveat appears is rejected, and (e) the empty-parent case requires the child to also be empty on that ability (both sides carry zero caveats — neither imposes a restriction). Order within a caveat object's own keys is normalized via canonical JSON serialization before counting, so key reordering inside a single caveat is not itself a difference; only differences in the multiset of caveat objects matter.
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` now enforces stricter selectedActionKeys/permissions consistency: `selectedActionKeys` must cover every non-required capability in `signedMessage`; every returned `permissions` entry action must appear in `signedMessage`; broader `permissions` entries are rejected; empty `permissions[]` with a capability-bearing SIWE is rejected; duplicate `selectedActionKeys` entries are rejected; and the resource-substring fallback used to resolve permission entries has been replaced with a canonical two-form resolver (space or space+path) that fails on ambiguity.
  - `node-sdk` adds `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKey(authorizeFn, opts)` — the production entry point that wires `prepareSessionForSigning` → OpenKey `authorizeTinyCloud()` → `signInWithOpenKeyResult` into one call. Callers provide a thin `authorizeFn` bridge to the OpenKey SDK; the node-sdk enforces every subset/immutable-field invariant before creating any session state.
  - `cli.parseDelegationExpiryField` numeric-seconds test fixture corrected (was passing `4_071_849_600` = Jan 11 2099, but expected Jan 1 2099 = `4_070_908_800`).
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` REJECTS legacy two-part `resource\0action` selectedActionKeys — Sol continuation contract requires the CANONICAL four-part `service\0space\0path\0ability` shape. The prior suffix-match fallback silently accepted IDs that did not carry a validated service namespace; four-part canonical IDs are the only accepted format.
  - `node-sdk` adds `wireOpenKeyAuthorize(openkey)` — a production adapter that translates any structurally-OpenKey object (typically `@openkey/sdk`'s `OpenKey` instance) into the `authorizeFn` callback `signInWithOpenKey` expects. The bridge does not fabricate protocol fields — every value flows through unchanged, and wire drift (missing `signedMessage`, unsupported `protocolVersion`, malformed selection) throws at the boundary. Enables real production consumers to wire OpenKey into `NodeUserAuthorization` without either package taking a direct build dependency on the other.

### Patch Changes

- cc75957: Sol continuation v2: add a production-shape narrowed-SIWE round-trip test
  to `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKey.e2e.test.ts` that exercises
  the client's `signInWithOpenKeyResult` acceptance path against the exact
  wire shape the OpenKey `/authorize-sign` route emits when a user narrows
  capabilities in the widget. The test asserts:
  - The narrowed `signedMessage` decodes to the expected reduced ability
    set (kv/put removed, kv/get + capabilities/read retained).
  - The ReCap-derived statement in `signedMessage` no longer mentions the
    removed abilities.
  - The signature verifies against `signedMessage`.
  - Every canonical four-part `selectedActionKeys` entry resolves to a
    real (resource, ability) pair.
  - Every `permissions` entry has non-empty actions and matches a resource
    in the signed ReCap.

  This complements the matching OpenKey-side test in
  `apps/api/src/__tests__/delegate-authorize-sign-nodeauth-e2e.test.ts`
  which invokes the actual Hono router with the same production-shape
  SIWE. Together the two tests cover the wire boundary from both sides
  using real production code paths.

- e525137: Address Sol continuation-review rejection blockers on the OpenKey
  authorization consolidation.
  - `sdk-core.ImmutableSiweFields` now covers the full immutable header set:
    `expirationTime`, `notBefore`, `requestId`, `statement`, and
    `nonRecapResources`. `extractImmutableSiweFields` parses them and
    `diffImmutableSiweFields` includes them so a widget swapping any
    of these fields fails the SDK's byte-for-byte immutable check.
  - `sdk-core.unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` now enforces STRICT normalized
    caveat-multiset equality. Dropping alternatives from a disjunction,
    adding restrictions to an unrestricted parent, and any lexical caveat
    change all reject. Formal attenuation may relax this later.
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` requires the returned `permissions`
    array to equal the signed authority for EVERY resource/action pair,
    including structurally-required capabilities (e.g.
    `tinycloud.capabilities/read`). Missing entries and extras both fail
    hard (was: only non-required coverage was required).
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKey` accepts an optional `openkeyKeyId` option
    and forwards it to the `authorizeFn` bridge so callers can pin the
    OpenKey key ID used by the widget.
  - `cli.auth request --grant` reports EFFECTIVE grants (from the signed
    delegation) rather than the originally-requested set — the previous
    behaviour over-reported authority when the user narrowed the request
    in the OpenKey UI. Applies to both OpenKey-backed and local-key flows.
  - `node-sdk` production TypeScript build no longer includes test sources
    or test-support modules, so `tsc --noEmit -p packages/node-sdk/tsconfig.json`
    now exits 0.
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKey` resolves the actual TinyCloud activation host
    before preparing or sending the OpenKey authorization request. A per-call
    host override is installed as the session host, so the host bound into the
    OpenKey context and the host later used for activation cannot diverge.

- ba9c983: Merge-readiness consolidation for the OpenKey authorization protocol.

  The manifest digest now uses a shared sorted-key canonical JSON protocol with
  OpenKey, so whitespace and object-key order in a published well-known manifest
  do not break origin binding. The mandatory cross-repository CI job is pinned to
  the immutable compatible OpenKey revision containing the real Hono harness.

  `sdk-core` (`packages/sdk-core/src/authorization/openkey-protocol.ts`):
  - Extend `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1` with an optional
    `manifests: Array<{ name?: string; appId?: string; payload?: Record<string, unknown> }>`
    field. Display-only. The receiving OpenKey side size-bounds and
    validates the envelope before use; envelopes carrying trust/verification
    override keys are dropped. Manifests never expand authority — the
    ReCap payload remains the sole gate.
  - Clarify in JSDoc that `reason` is caller-supplied context and
    rendered as "reason provided by caller" in the review UI unless a
    cryptographic manifest signature (or origin-bind) confirms it.

  `node-sdk` (`packages/node-sdk/src/authorization/NodeUserAuthorization.ts`):
  - `signInWithOpenKey` now builds a `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1`
    from `this._manifest` (when set) and forwards it to the caller's
    `authorizeFn`. The envelope carries `displayName`, `reason`
    (optional), `manifestId`, a canonical SHA-256 `manifestDigest` over
    the primary manifest, and the full `manifests[]` payload array.
    Callers can pass a `reason` string in `options` — rendered as
    caller-supplied, never as verified.
  - New `options.reason?: string` parameter for
    `signInWithOpenKey(authorizeFn, options)`.
  - Internal helpers `canonicalStringify` + `canonicalSha256Hex` produce
    a stable digest that the OpenKey server can match against the
    fetched `.well-known/openkey-manifest.json` bytes. Apps that want
    origin-binding MUST publish the same JSON at the well-known path.
  - The presentation envelope is forwarded VERBATIM through the
    `OpenKeyBridgeInput` shape; the bridge does not fabricate any
    fields.

  `node-sdk` (`packages/node-sdk/src/authorization/openKeyBridge.ts`):
  - Extend `OpenKeyAuthorizeTinyCloud.authorizeTinyCloud()` request
    shape and `OpenKeyBridgeInput` with the optional `presentation`
    envelope. `wireOpenKeyAuthorize` forwards it to the underlying
    OpenKey SDK unchanged.

  CI (`.github/workflows/authority-tests.yml`):
  - The isolated `authority` job now sets `OPENKEY_HARNESS_OPTIONAL: "1"`
    so the cross-repo Hono contract test skips gracefully when no
    sibling OpenKey developer worktree is present. Callers can no
    longer break the js-sdk CI merely by not having OpenKey checked out
    alongside.
  - New required `cross-repo-contract` job checks out BOTH js-sdk and
    OpenKey (from `openkey-so/openkey@main`) at compatible revisions,
    builds js-sdk's authority packages, and runs the cross-repo Hono
    contract test with `OPENKEY_WORKTREE` and `OPENKEY_RUN_HARNESS=1`
    set. The dedicated job means the real Hono contract remains
    MANDATORY — the escape hatch in the isolated job only prevents
    incidental breakage.

  Cross-repo Hono test:
  - `NodeUserAuthorization.crossRepoHono.e2e.test.ts` now spawns the
    OpenKey harness with `OPENKEY_RUN_HARNESS=1` set in the child
    environment. The harness carries a defence-in-depth guard that
    refuses to boot without that variable, so this cross-repo contract
    test is the only path that spins it up (a broad `bun test` walk in
    the OpenKey repo, or an accidental double-spawn, cannot leak a
    stuck Hono process on the port).

### Patch Changes

- 68faad4: Reduce published SDK bundle and WASM artifact sizes by enabling safe package tree-shaking, using ES2020 output, removing release source maps, and optimizing WASM for size. `@tinycloud/sdk-services` keeps its published root entries in the `sideEffects` allowlist because they install debug globals at module scope.

## 2.11.0-beta.5

### Minor Changes

- f0842d8: TC-373: fix two blockers found in review of the batched account-bootstrap seed-spaces write.
  - `KVService.batchPut` now attaches structured metadata (`requestMayHaveDispatched`, and on the two unconfirmed-2xx response paths, `responseReceived` / `status` / `outcome: "batch-unconfirmed"`) to `NETWORK_ERROR`/`TIMEOUT` failures instead of leaving them unclassified. No new `ErrorCodes` member is added — the ambiguity is carried entirely in `meta` to avoid widening the exported `ErrorCode` union.
  - `AccountService.spaces.registerBatch`'s internal ambiguous-failure classifier is now a strict allow-list (previously a deny-list that defaulted to "retry", so deterministic failures like 400/409/422, `INVALID_INPUT`, and 501/505 triggered five pointless per-space reconcile puts). `registerBatch` now returns `RegisterBatchSuccess` (`{ spaces, recoveredFromBatchError? }`) instead of a bare array, so a batch write that recovers via per-space reconciliation is visible on the success payload, not only via `console.warn`.
  - `TinyCloudNode.bootstrapStatus` gains an optional `warnings?: BootstrapWarning[]` field: bootstrap that completes via a recovered ambiguous write is now programmatically distinguishable from a clean run (both were previously `{ skipped: false }`).

  Both changes are additive; nothing published is broken.

## 2.11.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- b5d2e10: Stop browser sign-in hanging forever on an invisible space-creation dialog (TC-362).

  `ModalSpaceCreationHandler.confirmSpaceCreation` returned a promise that only ever
  settled on a click inside a shadow-DOM `<tinycloud-space-modal>`. When that dialog
  was not reachable — for example hidden behind an app's own full-screen "Connecting…"
  overlay — `ensureSpaceExists` awaited it forever and sign-in looked permanently stuck,
  with nothing in the light DOM to explain why.
  - The wait is now bounded (default 2 minutes, configurable via the new
    `TinyCloudWeb` config option `spaceCreationTimeoutMs` or
    `new ModalSpaceCreationHandler({ timeoutMs })`; `0` restores the unbounded wait).
    On expiry the handler closes the dialog and rejects with a `SpaceCreationTimeoutError`
    whose message names the element, the likely cause, and the three ways out.
  - **Behaviour change:** `autoCreateSpace` is now honoured in the browser. `TinyCloudWeb`
    used to install the modal handler unconditionally, and node-sdk gives an explicit
    handler precedence over `autoCreateSpace`, so the option was dead config in the browser.
    `autoCreateSpace: true` now creates the space with no dialog, `autoCreateSpace: false`
    skips creation entirely, and leaving it unset keeps today's modal confirmation.
    An explicit `spaceCreationHandler` still wins over both.
  - While the SDK is blocked on the user it sets
    `data-tinycloud-awaiting-user-input="space-creation"` on `<html>`, fires
    `tinycloud:awaiting-user-input` / `tinycloud:awaiting-user-input-resolved` on `window`,
    and logs an explanatory warning — so a stuck sign-in is diagnosable from outside
    the shadow root. New helper `pendingUserInputKind()` reports the same state.
  - The owner-policy sharing path signs mid-compose by re-opening the wallet/OpenKey
    signing surface. An unanswered or cancelled prompt there used to surface the same
    `PERMISSION_DENIED` "the active session ReCap does not authorize this sharing
    delegation" message as a genuine HTTP 403. It is now reported as `TIMEOUT` or
    `ABORTED` with a message that says what to do, and the underlying error is kept
    as `cause`.

## 2.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 9afb09c: Add localhost-first node resolution with identity pinning. Before falling back to registry/hosted resolution, `resolveTinyCloudHosts` now probes for a locally-running TinyCloud node (loopback, then `*.local.tinycloud.link`) and uses it if it answers and passes DID identity verification (trust-on-first-use, pinned per consumer). New opt-out and config knobs: `autoDiscoverLocalNode` (default true), `localNodeUrl`, `localLinkName`, `expectedNodeDid`, surfaced on node-sdk, web-sdk, and the CLI. Explicit host configuration (`host`, `--host`/`TC_HOST`) continues to skip discovery entirely.

### Minor Changes

- f7a1d4f: Add signed account-wide delegation history queries with lifecycle and revocation
  status, plus CID-bound delegation revocation receipts and the account-scoped
  delegation control capabilities used by SDK sessions.
- 4dee0a9: Add `sharing.delegateReceivedShare`, which exchanges a received `tc1` sharing
  link for a strictly attenuated child delegation without exposing the parent
  link or its embedded private key. Node `receive` now uses the same primitive
  when auto-subdelegating to its current session key. Delegation revocation can
  now be included in a consolidated manifest and uses the node's revocation
  endpoint so descendants are invalidated rather than recording a no-op invoke.
  The SDK also exposes node-confirmed delegation lifecycle status without
  returning delegation metadata.

### Patch Changes

- d6d5ef1: Restore persisted sessions with their original private Ed25519 signer.

Retired service graphs abort outstanding work and cannot reuse old encryption authority.

### Patch Changes

- 3841be4: Fix account bootstrap failing on fresh keys because `sqlForSpace()` dropped `invokeAny` (issue #300).

  `TinyCloudNode.sqlForSpace()` (and its `kvForSpace()` counterpart) cloned the
  active service context with only `{invoke, fetch, hosts, telemetry}`, silently
  omitting `invokeAny`. Account bootstrap routes through this path: the
  `account-index-schema` step calls `account.index.ensure()`, whose migration
  batch dedupes to multiple SQL actions (`tinycloud.sql/schema` +
  `tinycloud.sql/write`). A multi-action batch requires `context.invokeAny`, so
  with it undefined `SQLService.invokeSQLAny` threw
  "SQL operation requires multiple permissions ... does not support
  multi-resource invocations", and the first `signIn()` on a fresh key failed to
  provision the account index (the `secret-records-schema` step would have hit
  the identical failure). The "recovery" on a second `signIn()` was accidental
  and incomplete — the existence check could pass and skip the schema step,
  leaving accounts without the account index.

  Thread `invokeAny` from the primary service context (`this._serviceContext.invokeAny`)
  into the space-scoped context that `sqlForSpace()` and `kvForSpace()` build, so
  multi-action bootstrap migrations mint their authorization header correctly.

## 2.6.2

### Patch Changes

- b4d1e45: TC-111 follow-up: primary-grant selection now returns the caller's scoped
  session so multi-space recaps mint resources against the correct target space.

  TC-111 registers the primary session's own recap as a synthetic
  `provenance: "primary"` runtime grant that wins invocation selection when it
  covers the requested op. The two invocation call sites then used
  `grant.session` — the stored primary `ServiceSession`, whose `spaceId` is the
  PRIMARY space. For scoped ops on OTHER spaces that a multi-space recap also
  covers (e.g. an account-registry write whose fallback session targets the
  `account` space), the invocation was minted against the primary space
  (`applications/kv/...` instead of `account/kv/...`) and the node rejected it
  (observed as 404/40x in prod).

  `selectInvocationSession` and `invokeAnyWithRuntimePermissions` now invoke with
  the caller's passed/fallback session — which shares the primary delegation but
  carries the correct target `spaceId` — whenever the winning grant is the
  primary one. Non-primary grants keep using `grant.session`. Ranking semantics in
  `findGrantForOperations` are unchanged. This fixes wrong-space invocations for
  account/secrets ops that were minted against the primary space.

## 2.6.1

### Patch Changes

- bf31506: Stop emitting a doomed `tinycloud.space/list` invocation after manifest/recap
  sign-in (TC-110).

  `scheduleAccountRegistrySync()` unconditionally called
  `account.spaces.syncAccessible()`, which invokes `tinycloud.space/list` — a
  capability a manifest/recap session never holds — producing a benign but noisy
  `401 Unauthorized Action: …/space/ tinycloud.space/list` on every sign-in
  (visible in browser consoles).

  The sync now skips `syncAccessible()` when the current session's recap does not
  grant `tinycloud.space/list`, reusing the TC-111 `recapOperationsFromSession`
  primitive. Only sessions without a SIWE recap (session-only /
  restored-without-siwe) keep today's behavior — every wallet SIWE session in
  this stack carries a recap, and none of them grant `space/list`, so all of
  them skip.

  Behavior note: `syncAccessible()` on this path could only ever register
  capability-registry-derived **delegated** spaces (the owned-space listing 401
  was already swallowed by `SpaceService.list`). That sign-in-time delegated
  registration no longer happens; owned spaces are unaffected (bootstrap seeding
  - `spaces.register()`), and `account.spaces.list({ preferIndex: true })`
    self-heals via its own `syncAccessible()` fallback.

  Additionally, `withAccountRegistryRetry` no longer retries authorization
  verdicts (`Unauthorized Action` / 401): those are deterministic, not transient,
  so it warns once and stops instead of re-emitting the doomed request. Generic
  errors still get the full retry budget.

  Guard only — no registry-convergence writes and no sdk-core changes; the CLI
  (`tc account spaces sync`) still uses `syncAccessible()` for explicit discovery.

## 2.6.0

### Patch Changes

- ac48f85: Fix runtime permission selection so the primary session's own recap always
  out-ranks any other covering runtime grant (TC-111).

  Previously `selectInvocationSession`/`invokeAnyWithRuntimePermissions` picked the
  first covering grant in insertion order, so a broad — possibly broken —
  bootstrap or delegated grant could hijack an operation the primary session
  itself already authorized and 401. The primary session is now registered as a
  synthetic highest-trust (`provenance: "primary"`) runtime grant built from the
  raw SIWE recap (full owner-scoped space URIs, so owners can never be conflated),
  and grant selection filters covering grants then prefers the primary. Spaces the
  node skipped activating this sign-in are excluded from the synthetic grant so it
  can never out-rank a working grant. The synthetic primary grant is never exposed
  through `getRuntimePermissionDelegations`/`hasRuntimePermissions`.

- 2f31800: Consolidate hand-written capability URN lists into a single source of truth
  (`@tinycloud/bootstrap` `capabilities` module, TC-112). The registry is defined
  in tinycloud-node and vendored verbatim as
  `@tinycloud/bootstrap/src/generated/capabilities.ts`; the per-service constants
  (`KV`, `SQL`, `DUCKDB`, …), `CAPABILITY_REGISTRY`, `SQLAction`, `DuckDbAction`,
  the node-sdk default abilities and root-delegation grants, the bootstrap
  manifests, and the web-sdk permission-modal labels are all derived from it. A CI
  job diffs the vendored copy against the node registry at the pinned rev so the
  SDK can never silently drift from the enforcer.

  BREAKING (minor, pre-1.0): `SQLAction.INSERT`, `SQLAction.UPDATE`, and
  `SQLAction.DELETE` are removed — they were never dispatched by the SDK nor
  accepted by the node. `SQLAction.SELECT` is retained as a deprecated alias of
  `read`. `SQLAction.EXECUTE`/`EXPORT` and `DuckDbAction.DESCRIBE`/`EXECUTE` are
  retained as exported constants but are request-kind artifacts, not registry
  capabilities (the node routes them by request-body kind; wire alignment tracked
  in TC-114). All other action shapes are unchanged.

- 3ad0635: Mint the ability the node actually dispatches for SQL/DuckDB
  `execute`/`export`/`describe` (TC-114).

  `SQLService.executeStatementOnDb`/`exportDb` and
  `DuckDbService.executeStatementOnDb`/`describeDb` were sending the literal method
  name as the invocation ability (`tinycloud.sql/execute`,
  `tinycloud.sql/export`, `tinycloud.duckdb/execute`, `tinycloud.duckdb/describe`).
  The node has no such capabilities — it routes these requests by request-body
  kind gated by read/write/admin — so under chain containment a narrowly-delegated
  session (read+write, no `sql/*`/`duckdb/*` wildcard) 401s on these calls. They
  worked previously only because real grants carry the service wildcard.

  Each method now mints the dispatchable ability grounded in the node's routing:
  `export`/`describe` are authorized as reads (`tinycloud.{sql,duckdb}/read`) and
  named-statement execution as a write (`tinycloud.{sql,duckdb}/write`, which the
  SQL parser accepts for both read-only and mutating statements). Public method
  signatures and the exported `SQLAction`/`DuckDbAction` request-kind constants are
  unchanged. Narrowly-delegated sessions with no service wildcard now get working
  `export`, `executeStatement`, and `describe`.

- e07823b: Bump the tinycloud-node WASM-build pin to the v1.4.5 release tag and re-vendor
  the capability registry artifact (TC-119 / TC-121).

  `packages/sdk-rs/Cargo.toml` now pins `tinycloud-sdk-rs`/`tinycloud-sdk-wasm` to
  `tag = "v1.4.5"` (was `v1.4.2`). v1.4.5 is the first release that both contains
  the TC-112 capability registry AND wires it into the live `/invoke`//`/delegate`
  chain-containment paths (TC-119: alias/implication-aware delegation and
  invocation models). Unlike the v1.4.2 pin — where the registry was decoupled and
  the compiled WASM was unaffected — the WASM compiled from this pin genuinely
  changes (the `tinycloud-auth` crate it links in gained the W1 UCAN revocation
  handling shipped across v1.4.3–v1.4.5), so the published `web-sdk-wasm`/
  `node-sdk-wasm` binaries move.

  The vendored `@tinycloud/bootstrap` registry
  (`src/generated/capabilities.ts`) is re-vendored byte-identical from
  tinycloud-node@v1.4.5; the registry CONTENT (`REGISTRY_SOURCE_SHA256`,
  `CAPABILITIES`, `ALIASES`, `IMPLICATIONS`) is unchanged — only the new
  TC-121 `REGISTRY_SOURCE_REPO`/`REGISTRY_SOURCE_GIT_SHA` header exports and their
  doc comments are added. The capabilities-sync CI now anchors its fetch-and-diff
  to the explicit release-tag commit (`ANCHOR_NODE_REV`) rather than the header
  sha (which, for a locally-generated artifact, names the generation parent and
  would fetch the wrong artifact).

  (`src/generated/capabilities.ts`) is re-vendored byte-identical from
  tinycloud-node@v1.4.5; the registry CONTENT (`REGISTRY_SOURCE_SHA256`,
  `CAPABILITIES`, `ALIASES`, `IMPLICATIONS`) is unchanged — only the new
  TC-121 `REGISTRY_SOURCE_REPO`/`REGISTRY_SOURCE_GIT_SHA` header exports and their
  doc comments are added. The capabilities-sync CI now anchors its fetch-and-diff
  to the explicit release-tag commit (`ANCHOR_NODE_REV`) rather than the header
  sha (which, for a locally-generated artifact, names the generation parent and
  would fetch the wrong artifact).

## 2.6.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- 3ad0635: Mint the ability the node actually dispatches for SQL/DuckDB
  `execute`/`export`/`describe` (TC-114).

  `SQLService.executeStatementOnDb`/`exportDb` and
  `DuckDbService.executeStatementOnDb`/`describeDb` were sending the literal method
  name as the invocation ability (`tinycloud.sql/execute`,
  `tinycloud.sql/export`, `tinycloud.duckdb/execute`, `tinycloud.duckdb/describe`).
  The node has no such capabilities — it routes these requests by request-body
  kind gated by read/write/admin — so under chain containment a narrowly-delegated
  session (read+write, no `sql/*`/`duckdb/*` wildcard) 401s on these calls. They
  worked previously only because real grants carry the service wildcard.

  Each method now mints the dispatchable ability grounded in the node's routing:
  `export`/`describe` are authorized as reads (`tinycloud.{sql,duckdb}/read`) and
  named-statement execution as a write (`tinycloud.{sql,duckdb}/write`, which the
  SQL parser accepts for both read-only and mutating statements). Public method
  signatures and the exported `SQLAction`/`DuckDbAction` request-kind constants are
  unchanged. Narrowly-delegated sessions with no service wildcard now get working
  `export`, `executeStatement`, and `describe`.

## 2.6.0-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- ac48f85: Fix runtime permission selection so the primary session's own recap always
  out-ranks any other covering runtime grant (TC-111).

  Previously `selectInvocationSession`/`invokeAnyWithRuntimePermissions` picked the
  first covering grant in insertion order, so a broad — possibly broken —
  bootstrap or delegated grant could hijack an operation the primary session
  itself already authorized and 401. The primary session is now registered as a
  synthetic highest-trust (`provenance: "primary"`) runtime grant built from the
  raw SIWE recap (full owner-scoped space URIs, so owners can never be conflated),
  and grant selection filters covering grants then prefers the primary. Spaces the
  node skipped activating this sign-in are excluded from the synthetic grant so it
  can never out-rank a working grant. The synthetic primary grant is never exposed
  through `getRuntimePermissionDelegations`/`hasRuntimePermissions`.

## 2.6.0-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- 2f31800: Consolidate hand-written capability URN lists into a single source of truth
  (`@tinycloud/bootstrap` `capabilities` module, TC-112). The registry is defined
  in tinycloud-node and vendored verbatim as
  `@tinycloud/bootstrap/src/generated/capabilities.ts`; the per-service constants
  (`KV`, `SQL`, `DUCKDB`, …), `CAPABILITY_REGISTRY`, `SQLAction`, `DuckDbAction`,
  the node-sdk default abilities and root-delegation grants, the bootstrap
  manifests, and the web-sdk permission-modal labels are all derived from it. A CI
  job diffs the vendored copy against the node registry at the pinned rev so the
  SDK can never silently drift from the enforcer.

  BREAKING (minor, pre-1.0): `SQLAction.INSERT`, `SQLAction.UPDATE`, and
  `SQLAction.DELETE` are removed — they were never dispatched by the SDK nor
  accepted by the node. `SQLAction.SELECT` is retained as a deprecated alias of
  `read`. `SQLAction.EXECUTE`/`EXPORT` and `DuckDbAction.DESCRIBE`/`EXECUTE` are
  retained as exported constants but are request-kind artifacts, not registry
  capabilities (the node routes them by request-body kind; wire alignment tracked
  in TC-114). All other action shapes are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 3b23940: Fix bootstrap space manifests granting unusable root capabilities. The default, applications, and public space manifests declared kv/sql permissions with `path: "/"`, which the recap encoder joined into resources like `applications/sql//` (double slash). The node's byte-prefix resource matching can never extend such a resource, so every invocation riding a bootstrap session delegation was rejected with "Unauthorized Action" — this is what broke Listen's first conversations query after OpenKey auto-sign bootstrap. Root permissions now use `path: ""`, which encodes as `applications/sql` and correctly covers all paths under the service.

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b554d6: Add shared account APIs for applications and delegations, expose them from the node and web SDK clients, and add the `tc account` CLI command group.
- 75bebb1: Add account registry write-through indexing, account space registry APIs, and matching `tc account spaces` / `tc account index status` CLI commands.

  Manifest registration now records an indexed manifest hash and skips durable KV rewrites when the indexed record is current. Sign-in schedules best-effort background registry sync for application manifests and accessible spaces, while every discovered or hosted space is written through to the account registry index.

- eb44380: `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted` now consults the account spaces registry before hosting

  Previously `TinyCloudNode.ensureOwnedSpaceHosted(name)` always delegated to
  `hostOwnedSpace`, which unconditionally submits the host-SIWE delegation. Owners
  who already had the space hosted (e.g. a git-haiku owner re-running TinyCloud
  Secrets setup) were therefore prompted to "host" their `secrets` space on every
  run.

  `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted` now resolves the owned space id and first checks the
  account spaces registry: the fast SQLite index (`account.index.spaces.list()`)
  as a best-effort short-circuit, falling back to the canonical, recap-readable KV
  record `account/spaces/{space_id}` (`account.spaces.get`). If the space is
  already registered/hosted it returns the id WITHOUT submitting a host delegation
  (no redundant signature). Only when the space is absent — or the registry check
  fails in any way (e.g. a cold index reporting `no such table: spaces`) — does it
  fall through to `hostOwnedSpace`. After hosting it durably write-through
  registers the space so subsequent calls short-circuit on the registry.

  `hostOwnedSpace` (always-host) is unchanged for callers that explicitly want it.
  The KV path is used rather than `syncAccessible()` because a manifest/recap
  session can read `account/spaces/` under the recap but does not hold
  `tinycloud.space/list`.

- 27f97d8: Add a public `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted(name)` method to `TinyCloudNode` and `TinyCloudWeb` for hosting an owner's owned space (e.g. `"secrets"`) from a session created with a manifest / capabilityRequest.

  A full-authority sign-in auto-hosts the owner's `secrets` space, but a session created with a manifest / capabilityRequest does not. Such a session could hold valid `tinycloud.kv/*` capabilities for the owned `secrets` space yet still fail its first scoped `secrets.put(...)` with `404 Space not found`, because the space was never registered on the node. `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted(name)` resolves the name to the owner's owned-space URI and hosts it via the host-SIWE delegation flow (one signature, idempotent server-side), so subsequent scoped secret writes succeed.

- aa050d1: Resolve and rehydrate `tinycloudHosts` on restored sessions.

  A restored session never resolved its TinyCloud hosts: the restore path
  rehydrated the delegation/address/chainId but never set the hosts, and the
  hosts a session was created with weren't persisted. The first kv/secrets/
  space/encryption call on a restored session therefore threw "TinyCloud
  hosts have not been resolved. Call signIn() first." (notably when
  `signIn()` short-circuited to a restored session).

  Fix (three parts):
  - Persist the hosts: `PersistedSessionData` gains an optional
    `tinycloudHosts` field (back-compat — old persisted sessions still
    validate), and both sign-in save paths write the just-resolved hosts.
  - Rehydrate on restore: `TinyCloudNode.restoreSession` accepts the
    persisted `tinycloudHosts`, adopts them for the service context and the
    auth layer (`setRestoredTinyCloudSession`), and the web SDK threads the
    field through `restoreDataFromPersisted`.
  - Lazy fallback: sessions persisted before this field re-resolve their
    hosts lazily (registry → `node.tinycloud.xyz` fallback) on the first
    host-needing call, exactly like a fresh sign-in. Resolution failures
    surface rather than being masked.

  A restored session now targets the same node as the original sign-in, so
  apps no longer need to pass `tinycloudHosts` explicitly or call
  `clearPersistedSession()` before sign-in.

- 68b041b: Expose `sqlForSpace(spaceId)` and `kvForSpace(spaceId)` on `TinyCloudWeb`.

  These thin passthroughs forward to the underlying `TinyCloudNode.sqlForSpace`/`kvForSpace` (already used by the CLI), mirroring the existing `get sql()`/`get kv()` accessors. They let a browser/web-SDK app read or write a non-primary space — e.g. the pure-client viewer reading the artifact `feed` SQL and appending `interaction` rows under the owner's `applications` space.

### Patch Changes

- 0d397a8: Treat the account SQLite index as a materialized cache for user-facing account reads. Account application, space, and delegation list calls can now prefer the index while falling back to canonical account data when index tables are missing or empty, and account writes no longer fail when a best-effort index update fails.
- 895804a: Include `tinycloud.sql/ddl` in the implicit account registry index permission and legacy default SQL grant so account registry writes can create their SQLite tables and indexes on first use. SQL execute and batch calls now sign DDL statements with `tinycloud.sql/ddl`, and mixed batches sign with every required SQL action instead of collapsing to write-only.
- 6622043: Expose `account.index.ensure()` and `tc account index ensure` for lightweight account SQLite schema bootstrap, and start schema bootstrap with background account registry sync.
- bd8a60f: Remove the deprecated `SQLAction.DDL` export and the `tinycloud.sql/ddl` permission display path. SQL schema changes use `SQLAction.SCHEMA` and `tinycloud.sql/schema`.
- 7c5fe21: Automatically ensure owner-owned encryption networks exist during manifest-driven sign-in. When a requested `tinycloud.encryption/decrypt` permission targets the signed-in user's network ID, the SDK adds a separate scoped `tinycloud.encryption/network.create` sign-in grant and `signIn()` creates the network if the node reports it missing.
- da92ba7: Add a 30-day opt-out checkbox to the runtime permission request prompt so repeat permission escalations on the same page can skip the SDK explainer modal while still requiring the runtime permission grant.
- fa4a7c7: Add regression coverage for SQL migration batches that require both `tinycloud.sql/ddl` and `tinycloud.sql/write`, including the legacy-session runtime permission repair path used by TinyCloud Secrets.
- d4a0a69: Add a SQL migrations helper on database handles: `sql.db(name).migrations.apply({ namespace, migrations })`. The helper records applied migration ids in a TinyCloud-managed table, signs migration DDL/write/read actions through the SQL service, and returns whether migrations were applied or already current.

  The account registry index now uses the migrations helper for its schema setup, and SQL/DuckDB service errors sanitize non-JSON proxy HTML pages into concise retryable messages while preserving a bounded debug snippet in error metadata.

- a22a7f0: Rename the SDK-emitted SQL schema-change permission from `tinycloud.sql/ddl` to `tinycloud.sql/schema`, including manifest defaults and account-registry grants.

  TinyCloudWeb now treats a restored persisted session as stale when it does not cover the currently configured manifest permissions, then runs the normal manifest sign-in flow instead of letting apps request those manifest permissions separately after login.

- 42f1235: Add an opt-in TinyCloud debug logger controlled by `TinyCloud_debug`. The logger keeps a 1000-event in-memory ring buffer, writes structured events to `console.debug` when enabled, exposes browser console helpers for enabling, disabling, inspecting, and clearing logs, persists browser debug mode through `localStorage`, and captures service events plus `fetch`, `invoke`, and `invokeAny` timings.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 0401ff8: Add default TinyCloud host discovery and run it from sign-in when no explicit host is configured.
- 6561589: Add manifest v1 composition helpers, per-space capability requests, materialized manifest delegations, and the default account-space application registry grant.
- 8367cef: Store approved runtime permissions as narrow portable delegations and route matching invocations through them instead of expanding the app manifest and re-signing the whole session. `delegateTo()` can now derive from an installed runtime delegation, web permission requests return any created runtime delegations, and the secrets wrapper can use the SDK's connected signer when unlocking the backing vault.
- 35212bb: Add canonical scoped secret support. Manifest `secrets` entries now accept object specs with `scope` and optional `name`, and `tc.secrets` supports scoped `get`, `put`, `delete`, and `list` calls using the canonical `secrets/scoped/<scope>/<NAME>` vault layout.
- 46f126a: Add manifest `secrets` declarations and SDK helpers backed by the secrets space vault, including read-default permissions and write/delete escalation.
- 51b6f51: TC-1365: add browser session persistence/restoration for `TinyCloudWeb`.

  The web SDK now uses `BrowserSessionStorage` by default, validates persisted
  session data before writing it, reports restore status, rejects expired or
  corrupt stored sessions, and attempts to restore a valid session in
  `signIn()` before falling back to wallet login.

- 78ef7eb: Add `tinycloud.vault` as an SDK permission shorthand that expands to the backing KV permissions used by encrypted vault operations, including runtime permission escalation.

### Patch Changes

- 9ab4644: Check whether the manifest account registry space already exists before hosting it during sign-in, avoiding repeated account-space host prompts.
- b9a24b5: Add implicit space-level `tinycloud.capabilities/read` grants for every space touched by a manifest request.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8abfb4e: Bump past stale `2.1.0-beta.0` / `1.7.2-beta.0` ghost versions to publish PR #184's capability-chain delegation code.

  The earlier `2.1.0-beta.0` (TS SDKs) and `1.7.2-beta.0` (WASM) tarballs on npm predate PR #184 and are missing `resolveManifest`, `isCapabilitySubset`, manifest types, and the `parseRecapFromSiwe` re-export. This empty changeset forces `changeset version` to land on the next beta counter so the Beta Release workflow actually publishes the post-#184 code.

  All four TS packages in the linked group are named explicitly so `@tinycloud/sdk-services` advances too (naming only `@tinycloud/sdk-core` left it pinned at the ghost `2.1.0-beta.0`). Both WASM wrappers take a patch bump so the TS SDKs don't pin a stale `@tinycloud/*-sdk-wasm@1.7.2-beta.0`.

- 9dad135: Wire manifest-driven `signIn` and multi-resource `delegateTo` end-to-end (closes the two gaps in `2.1.0-beta.1`).

  `signIn` now reads `config.manifest` and resolves it (via `resolveManifest` + the new `manifestAbilitiesUnion`) into the WASM `abilities` map used by `prepareSession`. The resulting SIWE recap covers the union of the app's own permissions AND every manifest-declared delegation's permissions, so the session key acquires coverage for both runtime use and downstream sub-delegations in one wallet prompt. Apps that don't pass a manifest fall back to `defaultActions` (legacy behaviour, no change).

  `delegateTo(did, permissions)` no longer rejects multi-entry input. The SDK now folds every `(service, path, actions)` entry into a single multi-resource abilities map and calls the WASM `createDelegation` once — producing ONE signed UCAN whose `attenuation` carries every grant. The returned `PortableDelegation` has the new optional `resources?: DelegatedResource[]` field listing the full breakdown; the legacy flat `path` + `actions` fields mirror the first (sorted) resource for back-compat.

  Listen-style apps that needed to delegate KV + SQL on the same prefix to a backend can now do so in a single `tcw.delegateTo(backendDID, [...])` call with no wallet prompt.

  **Breaking changes** — pre-2.1.0-beta.2 callers will need to update:
  - `@tinycloud/sdk-core`: `CreateDelegationWasmParams` swaps `path: string; actions: string[]` for `abilities: Record<string, Record<string, string[]>>`. `CreateDelegationWasmResult` swaps the flat `path` + `actions` for `resources: DelegatedResource[]`. New exports: `DelegatedResource`, `AbilitiesMap`, `manifestAbilitiesUnion`, `resourceCapabilitiesToAbilitiesMap`.
  - `@tinycloud/node-sdk`: `TinyCloudNodeConfig` gains an optional `manifest?: Manifest` field. `TinyCloudNode` gains `setManifest(manifest)` and `manifest` getter passthroughs to the underlying auth handler. `delegateTo` no longer throws on multi-entry input — apps that relied on that behaviour for validation must add their own length check. `PortableDelegation` gains an optional `resources?: DelegatedResource[]` field.
  - `@tinycloud/web-sdk`: `TinyCloudWeb.setManifest()` now forwards the new manifest into the underlying `TinyCloudNode` so the next `signIn()` picks it up. `BrowserWasmBindings.createDelegation` signature aligned with the new WASM ABI.
  - `@tinycloud/node-sdk-wasm` / `@tinycloud/web-sdk-wasm`: the `createDelegation` WASM export takes `abilities: object` (multi-resource map) instead of `path: string, actions: string[]`. The Rust rev in `packages/sdk-rs/Cargo.toml` is bumped to the merge commit of the `feat/create-delegation-multi-resource` PR in `tinycloud-node`.

- 61c031d: Add write-hooks support across the JS SDK surface for SDK services, core, Node, and web packages.

### Patch Changes

- 303a8eb: Add an optional per-call `nonce` override to `signIn()` while preserving constructor-level `siweConfig.nonce` support.
- b88728a: fix(sdk-core): normalize space URI in recap parse for derivability check

  The Rust WASM `parseRecapFromSiwe` returns `space` as the full recap target
  URI (`tinycloud:pkh:eip155:{chainId}:{address}:{name}`), while manifest
  permissions and backend-advertised permissions use the short `{name}` form
  (e.g. `"default"`). `isCapabilitySubset` was doing strict string comparison
  on `space`, so mixing the two forms always failed — `delegateTo` would throw
  `PermissionNotInManifestError` even when the session recap covered every
  requested capability.

  This broke end-to-end manifest-driven sign-in in the listen app, where the
  session SIWE was signed correctly with the union of all manifest abilities
  but `delegateTo(backendDID, info.permissions)` still failed on the subset
  check because `"tinycloud:pkh:eip155:1:0xd559...:default"` and `"default"`
  didn't match as strings.

  Fix: add a `normalizeSpace` helper that extracts the trailing name segment
  from a `tinycloud:` URI. Apply it in `parseRecapCapabilities` (so the output
  is always in short-name form) and defensively in `isCapabilitySubset` on
  both sides (so callers passing either form work transparently).

- c586568: fix(node-sdk): activate WASM-path delegations with the host so downstream consumers can reference the parent CID

  `createDelegationViaWasmPath` (the session-key UCAN fast path used by
  `tcw.delegateTo` when the requested capabilities are derivable from the
  current session) was building the UCAN client-side and returning it
  directly without posting it to the host. This meant the host's delegation
  store never saw the UCAN.

  When a downstream consumer (e.g. a backend calling `node.useDelegation`)
  tried to reference the UCAN's CID as the parent of its own invoker SIWE,
  the host's chain-validation step failed with "Cannot find parent
  delegation" — the host looks up parents by CID in its local database,
  and the client-side-only UCAN was never stored.

  Fix: after computing the UCAN in `createDelegationViaWasmPath`, call
  `activateSessionWithHost` to POST the delegation header to `/delegate`
  before returning the `PortableDelegation`. This mirrors the legacy
  `createDelegationWalletPath` which has done the same for wallet-signed
  SIWE delegations since day one.

- 4fac901: Publish the UCAN delegation header fix from PR #192.

  `createDelegationViaWasmPath` now activates session-key UCAN delegations with
  the raw serialized JWT in the `Authorization` header instead of prefixing it
  with `Bearer `. The TinyCloud host decodes this header directly as a UCAN JWT;
  the prefixed value causes host activation to fail with 401 during
  manifest-driven `delegateTo` flows such as TinyBoilerplate/OpenKey sign-in.

- 9e05e08: Move webpack polyfill packages from dependencies to devDependencies to reduce install size for consumers
- 1379b11: Preserve `siweConfig` when upgrading from session-only mode via `connectWallet()` or `connectSigner()`
- e422647: Add top-level `nonce` field to `ClientConfig` / `TinyCloudNodeConfig` and ship the WASM rev bump carrying the SIWE nonce passthrough fix from tinycloud-node.
  - **WASM rev bump (previously merged without a changeset)**: `@tinycloud/sdk-rs` now tracks a tinycloud-node revision that accepts `nonce` in `SessionConfig`. Before this rev, `siweConfig.nonce` was forwarded by the TypeScript layer but silently dropped inside the Rust WASM layer. Single-signature auth flows that rely on server-provided nonces (e.g. billing sidecars) now work end-to-end.
  - **New top-level `nonce` field**: Callers can now pass `nonce` directly on `ClientConfig` / `TinyCloudNodeConfig` instead of nesting it under `siweConfig`. Precedence is `siweConfig.nonce` > top-level `nonce` > random (generated by the WASM layer), so `siweConfig.nonce` still wins when both are set. Omitting both preserves existing behavior.

## 2.0.3-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- 1379b11: Preserve `siweConfig` when upgrading from session-only mode via `connectWallet()` or `connectSigner()`
- e422647: Add top-level `nonce` field to `ClientConfig` / `TinyCloudNodeConfig` and ship the WASM rev bump carrying the SIWE nonce passthrough fix from tinycloud-node.
  - **WASM rev bump (previously merged without a changeset)**: `@tinycloud/sdk-rs` now tracks a tinycloud-node revision that accepts `nonce` in `SessionConfig`. Before this rev, `siweConfig.nonce` was forwarded by the TypeScript layer but silently dropped inside the Rust WASM layer. Single-signature auth flows that rely on server-provided nonces (e.g. billing sidecars) now work end-to-end.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 3401b3c: Fix siweConfig.nonce passthrough to SIWE message generation

  The nonce field from siweConfig was accepted in the configuration but never
  forwarded to the WASM prepareSession() call, causing server-provided nonces
  to be silently ignored. This broke single-signature auth flows where an
  external service (e.g. billing sidecar) provides a nonce for verification.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0499ab9: Remove legacy UserAuthorization, make WebUserAuthorization the default
  - Remove `useNewAuth` config flag — `WebUserAuthorization` is now always used
  - Delete legacy `UserAuthorization` class (1,231 lines)
  - Remove `isNewAuthEnabled` getter and all legacy mode guards
  - Auth modes simplified from legacy/new-wallet/new-session-only to wallet/session-only

- 855e0d9: Remove legacy code for v1 cleanup
  - Remove deprecated `onSessionExtensionNeeded` callback from SharingService (use `onRootDelegationNeeded` instead)
  - Remove deprecated `extendSessionForSharing()` method from TinyCloudWeb
  - Remove legacy `delegationCid` share link format support (only `cid` is supported)
  - Remove legacy fallback in `getSessionExpiry()`
  - Remove unused `express` and `express-session` dependencies from web-core

- ba988fb: feat: Add root delegation support for long-lived share links

  When creating share links with expiry longer than the current session, the SDK now creates a direct delegation from the wallet (PKH) to the share key, bypassing the session delegation chain. This allows share links to have any expiry duration regardless of session length.

  **New callback**: `onRootDelegationNeeded` in SharingServiceConfig
  - Called when share expiry exceeds session expiry
  - Receives the share key DID to delegate to
  - Returns a direct wallet-to-share-key delegation

  **Deprecated**: `onSessionExtensionNeeded` - does not solve the expiry problem as sub-delegations are still constrained by parent expiry.

  **Breaking change**: None - new callback is optional, falls back to existing behavior.

### Patch Changes

- ba988fb: Fix space-not-found race condition during sign-in. Both auth paths could complete signIn() without the space being active on the server, causing immediate "Space not found" errors from KV operations. Legacy path no longer silently swallows ensureSpaceExists() errors. New auth path throws when space creation modal is dismissed instead of returning silently.

  - @tinycloud/web-sdk-wasm@1.0.1
  - @tinycloud/web-core@1.0.1
  - @tinycloud/sdk-core@1.0.1

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 866981c: # v1.0.0 Release

  ## Protocol Version System
  - Added `checkNodeVersion()` to all sign-in flows for SDK-node compatibility verification
  - Added `ProtocolMismatchError` and `VersionCheckError` error types
  - SDK now requires TinyCloud Node v1.0.0+ with `/version` endpoint

  ## API Surface Cleanup
  - Replaced blanket `export *` with explicit curated exports
  - Renamed 40+ `TCW`-prefixed types (e.g. `TCWClientSession` -> `ClientSession`, `TCWExtension` -> `Extension`)
  - Trimmed internal utilities from public API surface

  ## Breaking Changes
  - All `TCW`-prefixed types have been renamed (drop the `TCW` prefix)
  - Blanket re-exports from `@tinycloudlabs/web-core` removed; use explicit named imports
  - Some internal sdk-core utilities removed from public API
  - `SharingServiceV2` alias removed; use `SharingService` directly

### Patch Changes

- b863afb: Fix sharing link delegation bugs
  - Fix 401 Unauthorized error: Clamp sharing link expiry to session expiry to ensure child delegation expiry never exceeds parent
  - Fix "Invalid symbol 32" base64 decode error: Remove incorrect "Bearer " prefix from authHeader in sharing link data

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c448f1: Update namespace references
- 2f7f0f4: added registry for node resolution and webpack build fix using polyfills

### Patch Changes

- 69fc83e: Fix space creation flow and host configuration consistency
  - Fixed sign-in flow to setup space session before calling extension hooks
  - Added `getTinycloudHosts()` method to `IUserAuthorization` interface
  - Updated `TinyCloudStorage` to use hosts from `UserAuthorization` for consistency
  - Fixed `tryResumeSession` to also setup space before extension hooks
  - Updated demo app to pass `tinycloudHosts` at top level config

  This ensures the space exists before `TinyCloudStorage.afterSignIn()` runs,
  preventing "Space not found" errors during session activation.

- 6cf4ef6: Update logging
- a2b4b66: Breaking API changes for node-sdk delegation system

  ### node-sdk

  **BREAKING: `allowSubDelegation` → `disableSubDelegation`**
  - Sub-delegation is now allowed by default (aligns with ocap/UCAN expectations)
  - Use `disableSubDelegation: true` to prevent recipients from creating sub-delegations
  - Before: `createDelegation({ allowSubDelegation: true })` to enable
  - After: `createDelegation({})` enables by default, use `disableSubDelegation: true` to disable

  **BREAKING: `autoCreateNamespace` default changed to `false`**
  - Namespaces are no longer auto-created during sign-in
  - Use `autoCreateNamespace: true` explicitly for namespace owners
  - Delegates using shared namespaces should not set this flag

  ### web-sdk
  - Fixed `KVServiceAdapter` to include `jwk` property required by `ServiceSession`

- a2b4b66: Refactor web-sdk to use shared sdk-core interfaces.

  Changes:
  - Add sdk-core dependency
  - UserAuthorization now implements IUserAuthorization from sdk-core
  - Re-export sdk-core interfaces (TinyCloud, ISigner, ISessionStorage, etc.)
  - Web-sdk can now be used with platform-agnostic sdk-core code

  Part of TC-401: IUserAuthorization shared interface implementation.
