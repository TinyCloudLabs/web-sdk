# @tinycloudlabs/node-sdk-wasm

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- c97e40d: Fix broken npm packages by removing invalid @tinycloud/sdk-rs dependency

  - web-sdk-wasm: Removed runtime dependency on sdk-rs (WASM is bundled by rollup)
  - node-sdk-wasm: Removed runtime dependency on sdk-rs, now properly bundles WASM files into dist/wasm/ during build

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 866981c: # v1.0.0 Release

  ## Protocol Version System

  - Added `checkNodeVersion()` to all sign-in flows for SDK-node compatibility verification
  - Added `ProtocolMismatchError` and `VersionCheckError` error types
  - SDK now requires TinyCloud Node v1.0.0+ with `/version` endpoint

  ## API Surface Cleanup

  - Replaced blanket `export *` with explicit curated exports
  - Renamed 40+ `TCW`-prefixed types (e.g. `TCWClientSession` -> `ClientSession`, `TCWExtension` -> `Extension`)
  - Trimmed internal utilities from public API surface

  ## Breaking Changes

  - All `TCW`-prefixed types have been renamed (drop the `TCW` prefix)
  - Blanket re-exports from `@tinycloudlabs/web-core` removed; use explicit named imports
  - Some internal sdk-core utilities removed from public API
  - `SharingServiceV2` alias removed; use `SharingService` directly

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- a2b4b66: Fix build order to ensure WASM artifacts are built before TypeScript packages

  Added `@tinycloudlabs/sdk-rs` as a dependency so turbo builds WASM first.

- a2b4b66: Rename web-sdk-rs to sdk-rs for clearer naming

  - Renamed `packages/web-sdk-rs` to `packages/sdk-rs`
  - Renamed WASM output directories:
    - `pkg` -> `web-sdk-wasm`
    - `pkg-nodejs` -> `node-sdk-wasm`
  - Updated all build scripts, documentation, and CI workflows

- Updated dependencies [69fc83e]
  - @tinycloudlabs/sdk-rs@0.3.1
