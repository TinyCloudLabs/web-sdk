### Minor Changes

- b38dd12: Add versioned OpenKey authorization protocol (v1) types and consumer wiring.
  - `sdk-core` exports `TinyCloudAuthorizationRequestV1`, `TinyCloudAuthorizationResultV1`, `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1`, `validateAuthorizationResultV1`, `isPlausibleOpenKeyActionId`, `OPENKEY_ACTION_ID_SEPARATOR`.
  - `sdk-core` also exports narrowing-verification helpers `extractImmutableSiweFields`, `diffImmutableSiweFields`, `extractRecapAttenuations`, `unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` (with `ImmutableSiweFields` and `RecapAttenuation` types) so consumers can prove that a widget-signed SIWE is a strict narrowing of the SDK's original prepared SIWE.
  - `node-sdk` adds `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult()` which completes the session with the exact `signedMessage` the OpenKey widget returned (not the caller's original prepared SIWE). Its `prepared` argument now REQUIRES `siwe` (the SDK-generated reference SIWE). Validates that the signature verifies against the returned bytes, that the recovered signer matches the local signer, that every immutable SIWE header field (domain, address, URI, version, chainId, nonce, issuedAt) is preserved byte-for-byte, that the ReCap capability set is a subset of the original request, and that `selectedActionKeys` are covered by that set. Note: `statement` handling was refined in `sol-final-continuation-fixes.md` — earlier drafts of this changeset incorrectly implied statement drift was always allowed; the delivered rule is that statement is byte-immutable for plain SIWEs and validated via the ReCap subset check for ReCap-bearing SIWEs.
  - `cli` browser-auth advertises `protocolVersion=1` on the /delegate URL, validates every callback payload before persisting (including structural checks on the optional `permissions[]` array), and (when the response includes effective `permissions`) refuses any grant that broadens the requested set.
  - `sdk-core.unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` now enforces EXACT MULTISET EQUALITY on the caveat list for every surviving (resource, ability) pair. Removing an entire ability or resource from the child is still permitted (that is genuine narrowing), but for any (resource, ability) that survives, the child's caveat list must equal the parent's caveat list as a multiset — i.e. same set of canonicalized caveat objects with the SAME duplicate counts. Concretely: (a) adding a caveat not present in the parent is rejected, (b) removing an alternative from a non-empty parent caveat list is rejected (removing all caveats to broaden from "restricted" to "unrestricted" is the special case of this), (c) replacing a caveat with a different one is rejected, (d) changing the number of times a duplicated caveat appears is rejected, and (e) the empty-parent case requires the child to also be empty on that ability (both sides carry zero caveats — neither imposes a restriction). Order within a caveat object's own keys is normalized via canonical JSON serialization before counting, so key reordering inside a single caveat is not itself a difference; only differences in the multiset of caveat objects matter.
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` now enforces stricter selectedActionKeys/permissions consistency: `selectedActionKeys` must cover every non-required capability in `signedMessage`; every returned `permissions` entry action must appear in `signedMessage`; broader `permissions` entries are rejected; empty `permissions[]` with a capability-bearing SIWE is rejected; duplicate `selectedActionKeys` entries are rejected; and the resource-substring fallback used to resolve permission entries has been replaced with a canonical two-form resolver (space or space+path) that fails on ambiguity.
  - `node-sdk` adds `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKey(authorizeFn, opts)` — the production entry point that wires `prepareSessionForSigning` → OpenKey `authorizeTinyCloud()` → `signInWithOpenKeyResult` into one call. Callers provide a thin `authorizeFn` bridge to the OpenKey SDK; the node-sdk enforces every subset/immutable-field invariant before creating any session state.
  - `cli.parseDelegationExpiryField` numeric-seconds test fixture corrected (was passing `4_071_849_600` = Jan 11 2099, but expected Jan 1 2099 = `4_070_908_800`).
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` REJECTS legacy two-part `resource\0action` selectedActionKeys — Sol continuation contract requires the CANONICAL four-part `service\0space\0path\0ability` shape. The prior suffix-match fallback silently accepted IDs that did not carry a validated service namespace; four-part canonical IDs are the only accepted format.
  - `node-sdk` adds `wireOpenKeyAuthorize(openkey)` — a production adapter that translates any structurally-OpenKey object (typically `@openkey/sdk`'s `OpenKey` instance) into the `authorizeFn` callback `signInWithOpenKey` expects. The bridge does not fabricate protocol fields — every value flows through unchanged, and wire drift (missing `signedMessage`, unsupported `protocolVersion`, malformed selection) throws at the boundary. Enables real production consumers to wire OpenKey into `NodeUserAuthorization` without either package taking a direct build dependency on the other.

- f0842d8: TC-373: fix two blockers found in review of the batched account-bootstrap seed-spaces write.
  - `KVService.batchPut` now attaches structured metadata (`requestMayHaveDispatched`, and on the two unconfirmed-2xx response paths, `responseReceived` / `status` / `outcome: "batch-unconfirmed"`) to `NETWORK_ERROR`/`TIMEOUT` failures instead of leaving them unclassified. No new `ErrorCodes` member is added — the ambiguity is carried entirely in `meta` to avoid widening the exported `ErrorCode` union.
  - `AccountService.spaces.registerBatch`'s internal ambiguous-failure classifier is now a strict allow-list (previously a deny-list that defaulted to "retry", so deterministic failures like 400/409/422, `INVALID_INPUT`, and 501/505 triggered five pointless per-space reconcile puts). `registerBatch` now returns `RegisterBatchSuccess` (`{ spaces, recoveredFromBatchError? }`) instead of a bare array, so a batch write that recovers via per-space reconciliation is visible on the success payload, not only via `console.warn`.
  - `TinyCloudNode.bootstrapStatus` gains an optional `warnings?: BootstrapWarning[]` field: bootstrap that completes via a recovered ambiguous write is now programmatically distinguishable from a clean run (both were previously `{ skipped: false }`).

  Both changes are additive; nothing published is broken.

- d894c57: TC-393: recover incomplete account bootstrap with a durable account-space
  completion marker, canonical account registry read/create-update/list, delegation,
  capabilities-read, marker, and SQL coverage, and an idempotent
  repair pass. One-shot CoordinationOS OpenKey sessions now explicitly disable
  client-side bootstrap.

### Patch Changes

- 746cb02: Stop implicitly probing `127.0.0.1` during TinyCloud host discovery. Loopback
  discovery now requires an explicit `localNodeUrl`, while configured and
  registry-discovered `*.local.tinycloud.link` nodes continue to work.
- d1d675b: Allow owner delegations to sign exact permissions across TinyCloud services, including the owner encryption network's decrypt capability, while preserving the legacy single-resource API.
- 44ecf56: Release the exact-head session invocation APIs and canonical recipient-DID policy support used by Share.
- cc75957: Sol continuation v2: add a production-shape narrowed-SIWE round-trip test
  to `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKey.e2e.test.ts` that exercises
  the client's `signInWithOpenKeyResult` acceptance path against the exact
  wire shape the OpenKey `/authorize-sign` route emits when a user narrows
  capabilities in the widget. The test asserts:
  - The narrowed `signedMessage` decodes to the expected reduced ability
    set (kv/put removed, kv/get + capabilities/read retained).
  - The ReCap-derived statement in `signedMessage` no longer mentions the
    removed abilities.
  - The signature verifies against `signedMessage`.
  - Every canonical four-part `selectedActionKeys` entry resolves to a
    real (resource, ability) pair.
  - Every `permissions` entry has non-empty actions and matches a resource
    in the signed ReCap.

  This complements the matching OpenKey-side test in
  `apps/api/src/__tests__/delegate-authorize-sign-nodeauth-e2e.test.ts`
  which invokes the actual Hono router with the same production-shape
  SIWE. Together the two tests cover the wire boundary from both sides
  using real production code paths.

- a7e3668: Sol final-continuation-review fixes on the OpenKey authorization consumer.
  Every claim below corresponds to a delivered test that fails on the prior
  implementation and passes with these changes.

  Requirement 1 — Canonical four-part action IDs across every producer/consumer.

  The on-wire structure of a TinyCloud ReCap resource is
  `<space>/<short-service>[/<sub-path>]`; the WASM `parseRecapFromSiwe`
  emitter strips the `<short-service>` segment out of `entry.path`. The
  prior `signInWithOpenKeyResult` inline resource parser kept the service
  segment INSIDE `path` (e.g. `path="kv"` for a `<space>/kv` resource),
  which produced a canonical four-part ID that never matched what OpenKey
  emits via `computeActionKey` (which uses WASM `entry.path` directly).
  Real production round-trips through the widget → API → js-sdk consumer
  therefore fell through the `grantedFourPartIndex.get(rawKey)` lookup
  silently — Sol explicitly cited this as blocking approval.

  Delivered:
  - `packages/sdk-core/src/authorization/openkey-protocol.ts` exports
    `parseCanonicalRecapResource(resource)` — a pure helper that strips
    the `<short-service>` segment out of `path` for `tinycloud:` URIs and
    returns non-`tinycloud:` URIs unchanged (e.g. raw
    `urn:tinycloud:encryption:...` resources emitted via `rawAbilities`).
  - `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult` uses this helper for
    both `grantedFourPartIndex` construction AND permissions-entry
    resolution. Non-`tinycloud:` URIs are now correctly resolved as
    space-verbatim (no `<short>` reconstruction).
  - Every test helper and integration test that builds four-part IDs from
    a signed SIWE now walks through `parseCanonicalRecapResource` — the
    `signInWithOpenKey.e2e.test.ts` `makeSimulatedOpenKey` bridge and
    the `signInWithOpenKeyResult.test.ts` `deriveSelectedActionKeysFromSiwe`
    and `derivePermissionsFromSiwe` helpers.
  - Tests in
    `packages/sdk-core/src/authorization/openkey-protocol.test.ts::parseCanonicalRecapResource`
    cover: whole-space grant (`path` empty), path-scoped grant (short
    stripped), repeated-space grant (`path` = space), non-tinycloud URN
    passthrough, and a cross-check against hardcoded expected-path values
    that match what real WASM `parseRecapFromSiwe` emits for those URI
    shapes (verified against a real WASM build offline; this test does not
    invoke WASM at runtime). The actual live-WASM evidence is in the
    separate mandatory cross-repository Hono finalize test.

  Requirement 1 (final) — Wire-format acceptance test at the HTTP boundary.

  Sol's final rejection called out that the js-sdk-side round-trip test
  routed through the `wireOpenKeyAuthorize` bridge and never handed a
  byte-shaped Hono `/authorize-sign` finalize body to the REAL
  `signInWithOpenKeyResult` consumer. The bridge translates types but
  does not fabricate any protocol fields — nevertheless, exercising
  the consumer with a directly-constructed wire body proves the
  contract at the exact boundary a compromised OpenKey response could
  attack.

  Delivered:
  - New tests in
    `packages/node-sdk/src/authorization/NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult.test.ts`: - `signInWithOpenKeyResult accepts a finalize body in the EXACT
wire shape the Hono /authorize-sign route emits` builds a real
    prepared session via the SDK, signs the exact prepared SIWE
    bytes with the local signer, and assembles a finalize body byte-
    for-byte in the Hono route's response shape (`{ protocolVersion,
address, signature, signedMessage, selectedActionKeys, permissions
}`). Passes DIRECTLY to `signInWithOpenKeyResult` — no bridge, no
    simulator. Asserts the consumer accepts the wire body end-to-end
    and produces a client session with the correct address and
    signed bytes. - `signInWithOpenKeyResult accepts a NARROWED finalize body in the
Hono /authorize-sign wire shape` performs the same test with a
    narrowed SIWE (regenerated via WASM `prepareSession`, which is
    exactly what OpenKey's `narrowSiwePreservingImmutable` calls),
    proving the consumer accepts both the identity round-trip and
    the narrowing round-trip when handed the actual Hono wire body.
  - Companion test on the OpenKey side
    (`apps/api/src/__tests__/delegate-authorize-sign-nodeauth-e2e.test.ts::
finalize body validates against a MIRROR of every
signInWithOpenKeyResult wire-format check`) asserts every wire-
    format guard the SDK consumer runs (protocolVersion, address shape,
    signature-verify, SIWE parseability, canonical four-part IDs, no
    duplicates, non-empty permissions, actions grounded in ATT). Together
    the two tests cover the boundary from BOTH sides using real
    production code paths.

  Requirement 2 — Narrowed OpenKey SIWE accepted by the SDK consumer.

  `WASM.prepareSession` renders the ENTIRE SIWE statement from the ReCap
  contents ("I further authorize the stated URI to perform the following
  actions on my behalf: ..."). Narrowing the ReCap therefore ALWAYS
  changes the statement. The prior `diffImmutableSiweFields` included
  `statement` in the immutable set unconditionally, which caused every
  legitimate narrowing to fail with `altered immutable SIWE fields:
statement` — the exact production round-trip failure Sol cited.

  Delivered:
  - `diffImmutableSiweFields(original, signed, { originalHasRecap })`
    accepts an optional flag. When `originalHasRecap === true`,
    `statement` is EXCLUDED from the diff and the ReCap subset check
    (`unauthorizedRecapCapabilities`) is the authoritative narrowing
    gate. When `originalHasRecap === false` (plain SIWE, no `urn:recap:`
    resource), `statement` remains byte-immutable — a caller-authored
    statement must not silently drift.
  - `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult` computes
    `originalHasRecap` from the prepared SIWE and passes it through.
  - Tests:
    - `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult.test.ts` — a
      narrowed-SIWE-with-ReCap-derived-statement test proves the full
      round-trip completes (was: rejected) AND asserts the pre-condition
      that the statement genuinely differs pre/post narrowing.
    - A contrapositive test proves `diffImmutableSiweFields` still
      rejects statement drift when `originalHasRecap: false`.

  What these changesets do NOT claim:
  - Cross-repo module import: the js-sdk and OpenKey ship independently
    with separate package managers and separate WASM builds. Instead,
    the js-sdk test constructs a Hono-route-shaped finalize body and
    hands it directly to the REAL `signInWithOpenKeyResult` consumer,
    while the matching OpenKey-side test asserts the actual `/authorize-
sign` route emits a response that passes every wire-format check
    the SDK runs. Together the two tests cover the boundary end-to-end.
  - Cross-signing broadening: the strict caveat multiset equality that
    Sol required lives on the OpenKey server side (see the matching
    OpenKey changeset). The js-sdk `unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` was
    already strict — no behaviour change on this side.

- e525137: Address Sol continuation-review rejection blockers on the OpenKey
  authorization consolidation.
  - `sdk-core.ImmutableSiweFields` now covers the full immutable header set:
    `expirationTime`, `notBefore`, `requestId`, `statement`, and
    `nonRecapResources`. `extractImmutableSiweFields` parses them and
    `diffImmutableSiweFields` includes them so a widget swapping any
    of these fields fails the SDK's byte-for-byte immutable check.
  - `sdk-core.unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` now enforces STRICT normalized
    caveat-multiset equality. Dropping alternatives from a disjunction,
    adding restrictions to an unrestricted parent, and any lexical caveat
    change all reject. Formal attenuation may relax this later.
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` requires the returned `permissions`
    array to equal the signed authority for EVERY resource/action pair,
    including structurally-required capabilities (e.g.
    `tinycloud.capabilities/read`). Missing entries and extras both fail
    hard (was: only non-required coverage was required).
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKey` accepts an optional `openkeyKeyId` option
    and forwards it to the `authorizeFn` bridge so callers can pin the
    OpenKey key ID used by the widget.
  - `cli.auth request --grant` reports EFFECTIVE grants (from the signed
    delegation) rather than the originally-requested set — the previous
    behaviour over-reported authority when the user narrowed the request
    in the OpenKey UI. Applies to both OpenKey-backed and local-key flows.
  - `node-sdk` production TypeScript build no longer includes test sources
    or test-support modules, so `tsc --noEmit -p packages/node-sdk/tsconfig.json`
    now exits 0.
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKey` resolves the actual TinyCloud activation host
    before preparing or sending the OpenKey authorization request. A per-call
    host override is installed as the session host, so the host bound into the
    OpenKey context and the host later used for activation cannot diverge.

- ba9c983: Merge-readiness consolidation for the OpenKey authorization protocol.

  The manifest digest now uses a shared sorted-key canonical JSON protocol with
  OpenKey, so whitespace and object-key order in a published well-known manifest
  do not break origin binding. The mandatory cross-repository CI job is pinned to
  the immutable compatible OpenKey revision containing the real Hono harness.

  `sdk-core` (`packages/sdk-core/src/authorization/openkey-protocol.ts`):
  - Extend `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1` with an optional
    `manifests: Array<{ name?: string; appId?: string; payload?: Record<string, unknown> }>`
    field. Display-only. The receiving OpenKey side size-bounds and
    validates the envelope before use; envelopes carrying trust/verification
    override keys are dropped. Manifests never expand authority — the
    ReCap payload remains the sole gate.
  - Clarify in JSDoc that `reason` is caller-supplied context and
    rendered as "reason provided by caller" in the review UI unless a
    cryptographic manifest signature (or origin-bind) confirms it.

  `node-sdk` (`packages/node-sdk/src/authorization/NodeUserAuthorization.ts`):
  - `signInWithOpenKey` now builds a `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1`
    from `this._manifest` (when set) and forwards it to the caller's
    `authorizeFn`. The envelope carries `displayName`, `reason`
    (optional), `manifestId`, a canonical SHA-256 `manifestDigest` over
    the primary manifest, and the full `manifests[]` payload array.
    Callers can pass a `reason` string in `options` — rendered as
    caller-supplied, never as verified.
  - New `options.reason?: string` parameter for
    `signInWithOpenKey(authorizeFn, options)`.
  - Internal helpers `canonicalStringify` + `canonicalSha256Hex` produce
    a stable digest that the OpenKey server can match against the
    fetched `.well-known/openkey-manifest.json` bytes. Apps that want
    origin-binding MUST publish the same JSON at the well-known path.
  - The presentation envelope is forwarded VERBATIM through the
    `OpenKeyBridgeInput` shape; the bridge does not fabricate any
    fields.

  `node-sdk` (`packages/node-sdk/src/authorization/openKeyBridge.ts`):
  - Extend `OpenKeyAuthorizeTinyCloud.authorizeTinyCloud()` request
    shape and `OpenKeyBridgeInput` with the optional `presentation`
    envelope. `wireOpenKeyAuthorize` forwards it to the underlying
    OpenKey SDK unchanged.

  CI (`.github/workflows/authority-tests.yml`):
  - The isolated `authority` job now sets `OPENKEY_HARNESS_OPTIONAL: "1"`
    so the cross-repo Hono contract test skips gracefully when no
    sibling OpenKey developer worktree is present. Callers can no
    longer break the js-sdk CI merely by not having OpenKey checked out
    alongside.
  - New required `cross-repo-contract` job checks out BOTH js-sdk and
    OpenKey (from `openkey-so/openkey@main`) at compatible revisions,
    builds js-sdk's authority packages, and runs the cross-repo Hono
    contract test with `OPENKEY_WORKTREE` and `OPENKEY_RUN_HARNESS=1`
    set. The dedicated job means the real Hono contract remains
    MANDATORY — the escape hatch in the isolated job only prevents
    incidental breakage.

  Cross-repo Hono test:
  - `NodeUserAuthorization.crossRepoHono.e2e.test.ts` now spawns the
    OpenKey harness with `OPENKEY_RUN_HARNESS=1` set in the child
    environment. The harness carries a defence-in-depth guard that
    refuses to boot without that variable, so this cross-repo contract
    test is the only path that spins it up (a broad `bun test` walk in
    the OpenKey repo, or an accidental double-spawn, cannot leak a
    stuck Hono process on the port).

  Documentation-only changeset for `@tinycloud/web-sdk` and
  `@tinycloud/sdk-services`; those packages export types re-exported
  from `sdk-core`, so the envelope shape change flows through
  transitively.

### Minor Changes

- b38dd12: Add versioned OpenKey authorization protocol (v1) types and consumer wiring.
  - `sdk-core` exports `TinyCloudAuthorizationRequestV1`, `TinyCloudAuthorizationResultV1`, `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1`, `validateAuthorizationResultV1`, `isPlausibleOpenKeyActionId`, `OPENKEY_ACTION_ID_SEPARATOR`.
  - `sdk-core` also exports narrowing-verification helpers `extractImmutableSiweFields`, `diffImmutableSiweFields`, `extractRecapAttenuations`, `unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` (with `ImmutableSiweFields` and `RecapAttenuation` types) so consumers can prove that a widget-signed SIWE is a strict narrowing of the SDK's original prepared SIWE.
  - `node-sdk` adds `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult()` which completes the session with the exact `signedMessage` the OpenKey widget returned (not the caller's original prepared SIWE). Its `prepared` argument now REQUIRES `siwe` (the SDK-generated reference SIWE). Validates that the signature verifies against the returned bytes, that the recovered signer matches the local signer, that every immutable SIWE header field (domain, address, URI, version, chainId, nonce, issuedAt) is preserved byte-for-byte, that the ReCap capability set is a subset of the original request, and that `selectedActionKeys` are covered by that set. Note: `statement` handling was refined in `sol-final-continuation-fixes.md` — earlier drafts of this changeset incorrectly implied statement drift was always allowed; the delivered rule is that statement is byte-immutable for plain SIWEs and validated via the ReCap subset check for ReCap-bearing SIWEs.
  - `cli` browser-auth advertises `protocolVersion=1` on the /delegate URL, validates every callback payload before persisting (including structural checks on the optional `permissions[]` array), and (when the response includes effective `permissions`) refuses any grant that broadens the requested set.
  - `sdk-core.unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` now enforces EXACT MULTISET EQUALITY on the caveat list for every surviving (resource, ability) pair. Removing an entire ability or resource from the child is still permitted (that is genuine narrowing), but for any (resource, ability) that survives, the child's caveat list must equal the parent's caveat list as a multiset — i.e. same set of canonicalized caveat objects with the SAME duplicate counts.

  - `node-sdk` adds `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKey(authorizeFn, opts)` — the production entry point that wires `prepareSessionForSigning` → OpenKey `authorizeTinyCloud()` → `signInWithOpenKeyResult` into one call. Callers provide a thin `authorizeFn` bridge to the OpenKey SDK; the node-sdk enforces every subset/immutable-field invariant before creating any session state.
  - `cli.parseDelegationExpiryField` numeric-seconds test fixture corrected (was passing `4_071_849_600` = Jan 11 2099, but expected Jan 1 2099 = `4_070_908_800`).
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` REJECTS legacy two-part `resource\0action` selectedActionKeys — Sol continuation contract requires the CANONICAL four-part `service\0space\0path\0ability` shape. The prior suffix-match fallback silently accepted IDs that did not carry a validated service namespace; four-part canonical IDs are the only accepted format.
  - `node-sdk` adds `wireOpenKeyAuthorize(openkey)` — a production adapter that translates any structurally-OpenKey object (typically `@openkey/sdk`'s `OpenKey` instance) into the `authorizeFn` callback `signInWithOpenKey` expects. The bridge does not fabricate protocol fields — every value flows through unchanged, and wire drift (missing `signedMessage`, unsupported `protocolVersion`, malformed selection) throws at the boundary. Enables real production consumers to wire OpenKey into `NodeUserAuthorization` without either package taking a direct build dependency on the other.

  capabilities in the widget. The test asserts:
  - The narrowed `signedMessage` decodes to the expected reduced ability
    set (kv/put removed, kv/get + capabilities/read retained).
  - The ReCap-derived statement in `signedMessage` no longer mentions the
    removed abilities.
  - The signature verifies against `signedMessage`.
  - Every canonical four-part `selectedActionKeys` entry resolves to a
    real (resource, ability) pair.
  - Every `permissions` entry has non-empty actions and matches a resource
    in the signed ReCap.

  This complements the matching OpenKey-side test in
  `apps/api/src/__tests__/delegate-authorize-sign-nodeauth-e2e.test.ts`
  which invokes the actual Hono router with the same production-shape
  SIWE. Together the two tests cover the wire boundary from both sides
  using real production code paths.

- a7e3668: Sol final-continuation-review fixes on the OpenKey authorization consumer.
  Every claim below corresponds to a delivered test that fails on the prior
  implementation and passes with these changes.

  Requirement 1 — Canonical four-part action IDs across every producer/consumer.

  The on-wire structure of a TinyCloud ReCap resource is
  `<space>/<short-service>[/<sub-path>]`; the WASM `parseRecapFromSiwe`
  emitter strips the `<short-service>` segment out of `entry.path`. The
  prior `signInWithOpenKeyResult` inline resource parser kept the service
  segment INSIDE `path` (e.g. `path="kv"` for a `<space>/kv` resource),
  which produced a canonical four-part ID that never matched what OpenKey
  emits via `computeActionKey` (which uses WASM `entry.path` directly).
  Real production round-trips through the widget → API → js-sdk consumer
  therefore fell through the `grantedFourPartIndex.get(rawKey)` lookup
  silently — Sol explicitly cited this as blocking approval.

  Delivered:
  - `packages/sdk-core/src/authorization/openkey-protocol.ts` exports
    `parseCanonicalRecapResource(resource)` — a pure helper that strips
    the `<short-service>` segment out of `path` for `tinycloud:` URIs and
    returns non-`tinycloud:` URIs unchanged (e.g. raw
    `urn:tinycloud:encryption:...` resources emitted via `rawAbilities`).
  - `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult` uses this helper for
    both `grantedFourPartIndex` construction AND permissions-entry
    resolution. Non-`tinycloud:` URIs are now correctly resolved as
    space-verbatim (no `<short>` reconstruction).
  - Every test helper and integration test that builds four-part IDs from
    a signed SIWE now walks through `parseCanonicalRecapResource` — the
    `signInWithOpenKey.e2e.test.ts` `makeSimulatedOpenKey` bridge and
    the `signInWithOpenKeyResult.test.ts` `deriveSelectedActionKeysFromSiwe`
    and `derivePermissionsFromSiwe` helpers.
  - Tests in
    `packages/sdk-core/src/authorization/openkey-protocol.test.ts::parseCanonicalRecapResource`
    cover: whole-space grant (`path` empty), path-scoped grant (short
    stripped), repeated-space grant (`path` = space), non-tinycloud URN
    passthrough, and a cross-check against hardcoded expected-path values
    that match what real WASM `parseRecapFromSiwe` emits for those URI
    shapes (verified against a real WASM build offline; this test does not
    invoke WASM at runtime). The actual live-WASM evidence is in the
    separate mandatory cross-repository Hono finalize test.

  Requirement 1 (final) — Wire-format acceptance test at the HTTP boundary.

  Sol's final rejection called out that the js-sdk-side round-trip test
  routed through the `wireOpenKeyAuthorize` bridge and never handed a
  byte-shaped Hono `/authorize-sign` finalize body to the REAL
  `signInWithOpenKeyResult` consumer. The bridge translates types but
  does not fabricate any protocol fields — nevertheless, exercising
  the consumer with a directly-constructed wire body proves the
  contract at the exact boundary a compromised OpenKey response could
  attack.

  Delivered:
  - New tests in
    `packages/node-sdk/src/authorization/NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult.test.ts`: - `signInWithOpenKeyResult accepts a finalize body in the EXACT
wire shape the Hono /authorize-sign route emits` builds a real
    prepared session via the SDK, signs the exact prepared SIWE
    bytes with the local signer, and assembles a finalize body byte-
    for-byte in the Hono route's response shape (`{ protocolVersion,
address, signature, signedMessage, selectedActionKeys, permissions
}`). Passes DIRECTLY to `signInWithOpenKeyResult` — no bridge, no
    simulator. Asserts the consumer accepts the wire body end-to-end
    and produces a client session with the correct address and
    signed bytes. - `signInWithOpenKeyResult accepts a NARROWED finalize body in the
Hono /authorize-sign wire shape` performs the same test with a
    narrowed SIWE (regenerated via WASM `prepareSession`, which is
    exactly what OpenKey's `narrowSiwePreservingImmutable` calls),
    proving the consumer accepts both the identity round-trip and
    the narrowing round-trip when handed the actual Hono wire body.
  - Companion test on the OpenKey side
    (`apps/api/src/__tests__/delegate-authorize-sign-nodeauth-e2e.test.ts::
finalize body validates against a MIRROR of every
signInWithOpenKeyResult wire-format check`) asserts every wire-
    format guard the SDK consumer runs (protocolVersion, address shape,
    signature-verify, SIWE parseability, canonical four-part IDs, no
    duplicates, non-empty permissions, actions grounded in ATT). Together
    the two tests cover the boundary from BOTH sides using real
    production code paths.

  Requirement 2 — Narrowed OpenKey SIWE accepted by the SDK consumer.

  `WASM.prepareSession` renders the ENTIRE SIWE statement from the ReCap
  contents ("I further authorize the stated URI to perform the following
  actions on my behalf: ..."). Narrowing the ReCap therefore ALWAYS
  changes the statement. The prior `diffImmutableSiweFields` included
  `statement` in the immutable set unconditionally, which caused every
  legitimate narrowing to fail with `altered immutable SIWE fields:
statement` — the exact production round-trip failure Sol cited.

  Delivered:
  - `diffImmutableSiweFields(original, signed, { originalHasRecap })`
    accepts an optional flag. When `originalHasRecap === true`,
    `statement` is EXCLUDED from the diff and the ReCap subset check
    (`unauthorizedRecapCapabilities`) is the authoritative narrowing
    gate. When `originalHasRecap === false` (plain SIWE, no `urn:recap:`
    resource), `statement` remains byte-immutable — a caller-authored
    statement must not silently drift.
  - `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult` computes
    `originalHasRecap` from the prepared SIWE and passes it through.
  - Tests:
    - `NodeUserAuthorization.signInWithOpenKeyResult.test.ts` — a
      narrowed-SIWE-with-ReCap-derived-statement test proves the full
      round-trip completes (was: rejected) AND asserts the pre-condition
      that the statement genuinely differs pre/post narrowing.
    - A contrapositive test proves `diffImmutableSiweFields` still
      rejects statement drift when `originalHasRecap: false`.

  What these changesets do NOT claim:
  - Cross-repo module import: the js-sdk and OpenKey ship independently
    with separate package managers and separate WASM builds. Instead,
    the js-sdk test constructs a Hono-route-shaped finalize body and
    hands it directly to the REAL `signInWithOpenKeyResult` consumer,
    while the matching OpenKey-side test asserts the actual `/authorize-
sign` route emits a response that passes every wire-format check
    the SDK runs. Together the two tests cover the boundary end-to-end.
  - Cross-signing broadening: the strict caveat multiset equality that
    Sol required lives on the OpenKey server side (see the matching
    OpenKey changeset). The js-sdk `unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` was
    already strict — no behaviour change on this side.

- e525137: Address Sol continuation-review rejection blockers on the OpenKey
  authorization consolidation.
  - `sdk-core.ImmutableSiweFields` now covers the full immutable header set:
    `expirationTime`, `notBefore`, `requestId`, `statement`, and
    `nonRecapResources`. `extractImmutableSiweFields` parses them and
    `diffImmutableSiweFields` includes them so a widget swapping any
    of these fields fails the SDK's byte-for-byte immutable check.
  - `sdk-core.unauthorizedRecapCapabilities` now enforces STRICT normalized
    caveat-multiset equality. Dropping alternatives from a disjunction,
    adding restrictions to an unrestricted parent, and any lexical caveat
    change all reject. Formal attenuation may relax this later.
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKeyResult` requires the returned `permissions`
    array to equal the signed authority for EVERY resource/action pair,
    including structurally-required capabilities (e.g.
    `tinycloud.capabilities/read`). Missing entries and extras both fail
    hard (was: only non-required coverage was required).
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKey` accepts an optional `openkeyKeyId` option
    and forwards it to the `authorizeFn` bridge so callers can pin the
    OpenKey key ID used by the widget.
  - `cli.auth request --grant` reports EFFECTIVE grants (from the signed
    delegation) rather than the originally-requested set — the previous
    behaviour over-reported authority when the user narrowed the request
    in the OpenKey UI. Applies to both OpenKey-backed and local-key flows.
  - `node-sdk` production TypeScript build no longer includes test sources
    or test-support modules, so `tsc --noEmit -p packages/node-sdk/tsconfig.json`
    now exits 0.
  - `node-sdk.signInWithOpenKey` resolves the actual TinyCloud activation host
    before preparing or sending the OpenKey authorization request. A per-call
    host override is installed as the session host, so the host bound into the
    OpenKey context and the host later used for activation cannot diverge.

- ba9c983: Merge-readiness consolidation for the OpenKey authorization protocol.

  The manifest digest now uses a shared sorted-key canonical JSON protocol with
  OpenKey, so whitespace and object-key order in a published well-known manifest
  do not break origin binding. The mandatory cross-repository CI job is pinned to
  the immutable compatible OpenKey revision containing the real Hono harness.

  `sdk-core` (`packages/sdk-core/src/authorization/openkey-protocol.ts`):
  - Extend `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1` with an optional
    `manifests: Array<{ name?: string; appId?: string; payload?: Record<string, unknown> }>`
    field. Display-only. The receiving OpenKey side size-bounds and
    validates the envelope before use; envelopes carrying trust/verification
    override keys are dropped. Manifests never expand authority — the
    ReCap payload remains the sole gate.
  - Clarify in JSDoc that `reason` is caller-supplied context and
    rendered as "reason provided by caller" in the review UI unless a
    cryptographic manifest signature (or origin-bind) confirms it.

  `node-sdk` (`packages/node-sdk/src/authorization/NodeUserAuthorization.ts`):
  - `signInWithOpenKey` now builds a `CapabilityPresentationEnvelopeV1`
    from `this._manifest` (when set) and forwards it to the caller's
    `authorizeFn`. The envelope carries `displayName`, `reason`
    (optional), `manifestId`, a canonical SHA-256 `manifestDigest` over
    the primary manifest, and the full `manifests[]` payload array.
    Callers can pass a `reason` string in `options` — rendered as
    caller-supplied, never as verified.
  - New `options.reason?: string` parameter for
    `signInWithOpenKey(authorizeFn, options)`.
  - Internal helpers `canonicalStringify` + `canonicalSha256Hex` produce
    a stable digest that the OpenKey server can match against the
    fetched `.well-known/openkey-manifest.json` bytes. Apps that want
    origin-binding MUST publish the same JSON at the well-known path.
  - The presentation envelope is forwarded VERBATIM through the
    `OpenKeyBridgeInput` shape; the bridge does not fabricate any
    fields.

  `node-sdk` (`packages/node-sdk/src/authorization/openKeyBridge.ts`):
  - Extend `OpenKeyAuthorizeTinyCloud.authorizeTinyCloud()` request
    shape and `OpenKeyBridgeInput` with the optional `presentation`
    envelope. `wireOpenKeyAuthorize` forwards it to the underlying
    OpenKey SDK unchanged.

  CI (`.github/workflows/authority-tests.yml`):
  - The isolated `authority` job now sets `OPENKEY_HARNESS_OPTIONAL: "1"`
    so the cross-repo Hono contract test skips gracefully when no
    sibling OpenKey developer worktree is present. Callers can no
    longer break the js-sdk CI merely by not having OpenKey checked out
    alongside.
  - New required `cross-repo-contract` job checks out BOTH js-sdk and
    OpenKey (from `openkey-so/openkey@main`) at compatible revisions,
    builds js-sdk's authority packages, and runs the cross-repo Hono
    contract test with `OPENKEY_WORKTREE` and `OPENKEY_RUN_HARNESS=1`
    set. The dedicated job means the real Hono contract remains
    MANDATORY — the escape hatch in the isolated job only prevents
    incidental breakage.

  Cross-repo Hono test:
  - `NodeUserAuthorization.crossRepoHono.e2e.test.ts` now spawns the
    OpenKey harness with `OPENKEY_RUN_HARNESS=1` set in the child
    environment. The harness carries a defence-in-depth guard that
    refuses to boot without that variable, so this cross-repo contract
    test is the only path that spins it up (a broad `bun test` walk in
    the OpenKey repo, or an accidental double-spawn, cannot leak a
    stuck Hono process on the port).

  Documentation-only changeset for `@tinycloud/web-sdk` and
  `@tinycloud/sdk-services`; those packages export types re-exported
  from `sdk-core`, so the envelope shape change flows through
  transitively.

### Minor Changes

- f0842d8: TC-373: fix two blockers found in review of the batched account-bootstrap seed-spaces write.
  - `KVService.batchPut` now attaches structured metadata (`requestMayHaveDispatched`, and on the two unconfirmed-2xx response paths, `responseReceived` / `status` / `outcome: "batch-unconfirmed"`) to `NETWORK_ERROR`/`TIMEOUT` failures instead of leaving them unclassified. No new `ErrorCodes` member is added — the ambiguity is carried entirely in `meta` to avoid widening the exported `ErrorCode` union.
  - `AccountService.spaces.registerBatch`'s internal ambiguous-failure classifier is now a strict allow-list (previously a deny-list that defaulted to "retry", so deterministic failures like 400/409/422, `INVALID_INPUT`, and 501/505 triggered five pointless per-space reconcile puts). `registerBatch` now returns `RegisterBatchSuccess` (`{ spaces, recoveredFromBatchError? }`) instead of a bare array, so a batch write that recovers via per-space reconciliation is visible on the success payload, not only via `console.warn`.
  - `TinyCloudNode.bootstrapStatus` gains an optional `warnings?: BootstrapWarning[]` field: bootstrap that completes via a recovered ambiguous write is now programmatically distinguishable from a clean run (both were previously `{ skipped: false }`).

  Both changes are additive; nothing published is broken.

### Minor Changes

- 9afb09c: Add localhost-first node resolution with identity pinning. Before falling back to registry/hosted resolution, `resolveTinyCloudHosts` now probes for a locally-running TinyCloud node (loopback, then `*.local.tinycloud.link`) and uses it if it answers and passes DID identity verification (trust-on-first-use, pinned per consumer). New opt-out and config knobs: `autoDiscoverLocalNode` (default true), `localNodeUrl`, `localLinkName`, `expectedNodeDid`, surfaced on node-sdk, web-sdk, and the CLI. Explicit host configuration (`host`, `--host`/`TC_HOST`) continues to skip discovery entirely.

### Minor Changes

- f7a1d4f: Add signed account-wide delegation history queries with lifecycle and revocation
  status, plus CID-bound delegation revocation receipts and the account-scoped
  delegation control capabilities used by SDK sessions.
- 4dee0a9: Add `sharing.delegateReceivedShare`, which exchanges a received `tc1` sharing
  link for a strictly attenuated child delegation without exposing the parent
  link or its embedded private key. Node `receive` now uses the same primitive
  when auto-subdelegating to its current session key. Delegation revocation can
  now be included in a consolidated manifest and uses the node's revocation
  endpoint so descendants are invalidated rather than recording a no-op invoke.
  The SDK also exposes node-confirmed delegation lifecycle status without
  returning delegation metadata.
- cd8c11f: Add an explicit-space classified secret-read API that preserves safe KV,
  envelope, decrypt, and payload failure phases without changing legacy secret
  reads.
- 1606a6f: Expose exact, expiry-pruned effective capabilities from activated runtime grants.

### Patch Changes

- 367c17c: Normalize session verification-method DID URLs to principal DIDs at the WASM delegation boundary so session-key delegations accept persisted `did:key:...#key-id` identities.
- 1269a58: Add canonical delegated account-space, application, and generic non-secrets KV exploration operations. Publish the beta MCP package with four corresponding read-only tools and a documented exact request, owner grant, import, restart, and retry workflow. Allow a fresh delegate profile to bootstrap from its first request-bound delegation while preserving canonical import validation.
- f6048b7: Keep TinyCloudNode session-key accessors synchronized with the active key and make repeated sign-in rotate that key safely, so delegation flows do not reference the removed default key.
- f5b1c75: Repair I2 release artifacts: bundle ESM-only multiformats dependencies for Node CommonJS consumers, preserve safe delegation mismatch details, and publish the canonical CLI auth import route.
- b982b90: Declare Node 20 or newer as the supported runtime floor for the complete published SDK and Operations graph, including the CLI and Node WASM bindings.
- d6d5ef1: Restore persisted sessions with their original private Ed25519 signer. Verify the signed SIWE, ReCap, Cacao header/CID, address, chain, session DID, and expiry before installing authority; atomically replace the auth/core/service host context while retaining every live secondary signer. Retired service graphs abort outstanding work and cannot reuse old encryption authority. Browser restore now preserves spaces and policy expiry, and rejected restores leave persisted storage untouched.
- 8777823: Add a CID-bound `activateValidatedRuntimeDelegation` helper that validates and installs compact UCAN runtime delegations.
- 96b9e21: Add `TinyCloudNode#getVerifiedSessionCapabilities` for the authenticated session's signed ReCap authority.

## 2.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 3841be4: Fix account bootstrap failing on fresh keys because `sqlForSpace()` dropped `invokeAny` (issue #300).

  `TinyCloudNode.sqlForSpace()` (and its `kvForSpace()` counterpart) cloned the
  active service context with only `{invoke, fetch, hosts, telemetry}`, silently
  omitting `invokeAny`. Account bootstrap routes through this path: the
  `account-index-schema` step calls `account.index.ensure()`, whose migration
  batch dedupes to multiple SQL actions (`tinycloud.sql/schema` +
  `tinycloud.sql/write`). A multi-action batch requires `context.invokeAny`, so
  with it undefined `SQLService.invokeSQLAny` threw
  "SQL operation requires multiple permissions ... does not support
  multi-resource invocations", and the first `signIn()` on a fresh key failed to
  provision the account index (the `secret-records-schema` step would have hit
  the identical failure). The "recovery" on a second `signIn()` was accidental
  and incomplete — the existence check could pass and skip the schema step,
  leaving accounts without the account index.

  Thread `invokeAny` from the primary service context (`this._serviceContext.invokeAny`)
  into the space-scoped context that `sqlForSpace()` and `kvForSpace()` build, so
  multi-action bootstrap migrations mint their authorization header correctly.

  `tinycloud.sql/write`). A multi-action batch requires `context.invokeAny`, so
  with it undefined `SQLService.invokeSQLAny` threw
  "SQL operation requires multiple permissions ... does not support
  multi-resource invocations", and the first `signIn()` on a fresh key failed to
  provision the account index (the `secret-records-schema` step would have hit
  the identical failure). The "recovery" on a second `signIn()` was accidental
  and incomplete — the existence check could pass and skip the schema step,
  leaving accounts without the account index.

  Thread `invokeAny` from the primary service context (`this._serviceContext.invokeAny`)
  into the space-scoped context that `sqlForSpace()` and `kvForSpace()` build, so
  multi-action bootstrap migrations mint their authorization header correctly.

## 2.6.2

### Patch Changes

- b4d1e45: TC-111 follow-up: primary-grant selection now returns the caller's scoped
  session so multi-space recaps mint resources against the correct target space.

  TC-111 registers the primary session's own recap as a synthetic
  `provenance: "primary"` runtime grant that wins invocation selection when it
  covers the requested op. The two invocation call sites then used
  `grant.session` — the stored primary `ServiceSession`, whose `spaceId` is the
  PRIMARY space. For scoped ops on OTHER spaces that a multi-space recap also
  covers (e.g. an account-registry write whose fallback session targets the
  `account` space), the invocation was minted against the primary space
  (`applications/kv/...` instead of `account/kv/...`) and the node rejected it
  (observed as 404/40x in prod).

  `selectInvocationSession` and `invokeAnyWithRuntimePermissions` now invoke with
  the caller's passed/fallback session — which shares the primary delegation but
  carries the correct target `spaceId` — whenever the winning grant is the
  primary one. Non-primary grants keep using `grant.session`. Ranking semantics in
  `findGrantForOperations` are unchanged. This fixes wrong-space invocations for
  account/secrets ops that were minted against the primary space.

### Patch Changes

- bf31506: Stop emitting a doomed `tinycloud.space/list` invocation after manifest/recap
  sign-in (TC-110).

  `scheduleAccountRegistrySync()` unconditionally called
  `account.spaces.syncAccessible()`, which invokes `tinycloud.space/list` — a
  capability a manifest/recap session never holds — producing a benign but noisy
  `401 Unauthorized Action: …/space/ tinycloud.space/list` on every sign-in
  (visible in browser consoles).

  The sync now skips `syncAccessible()` when the current session's recap does not
  grant `tinycloud.space/list`, reusing the TC-111 `recapOperationsFromSession`
  primitive. Only sessions without a SIWE recap (session-only /
  restored-without-siwe) keep today's behavior — every wallet SIWE session in
  this stack carries a recap, and none of them grant `space/list`, so all of
  them skip.

  Behavior note: `syncAccessible()` on this path could only ever register
  capability-registry-derived **delegated** spaces (the owned-space listing 401
  was already swallowed by `SpaceService.list`). That sign-in-time delegated
  registration no longer happens; owned spaces are unaffected (bootstrap seeding
  - `spaces.register()`), and `account.spaces.list({ preferIndex: true })`
    self-heals via its own `syncAccessible()` fallback.

  Additionally, `withAccountRegistryRetry` no longer retries authorization
  verdicts (`Unauthorized Action` / 401): those are deterministic, not transient,
  so it warns once and stops instead of re-emitting the doomed request. Generic
  errors still get the full retry budget.

  Guard only — no registry-convergence writes and no sdk-core changes; the CLI
  (`tc account spaces sync`) still uses `syncAccessible()` for explicit discovery.

### Minor Changes

- 2f31800: Consolidate hand-written capability URN lists into a single source of truth
  (`@tinycloud/bootstrap` `capabilities` module, TC-112). The registry is defined
  in tinycloud-node and vendored verbatim as
  `@tinycloud/bootstrap/src/generated/capabilities.ts`; the per-service constants
  (`KV`, `SQL`, `DUCKDB`, …), `CAPABILITY_REGISTRY`, `SQLAction`, `DuckDbAction`,
  the node-sdk default abilities and root-delegation grants, the bootstrap
  manifests, and the web-sdk permission-modal labels are all derived from it. A CI
  job diffs the vendored copy against the node registry at the pinned rev so the
  SDK can never silently drift from the enforcer.

  BREAKING (minor, pre-1.0): `SQLAction.INSERT`, `SQLAction.UPDATE`, and
  `SQLAction.DELETE` are removed — they were never dispatched by the SDK nor
  accepted by the node. `SQLAction.SELECT` is retained as a deprecated alias of
  `read`. `SQLAction.EXECUTE`/`EXPORT` and `DuckDbAction.DESCRIBE`/`EXECUTE` are
  retained as exported constants but are request-kind artifacts, not registry
  capabilities (the node routes them by request-body kind; wire alignment tracked
  in TC-114). All other action shapes are unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- ac48f85: Fix runtime permission selection so the primary session's own recap always
  out-ranks any other covering runtime grant (TC-111).

  Previously `selectInvocationSession`/`invokeAnyWithRuntimePermissions` picked the
  first covering grant in insertion order, so a broad — possibly broken —
  bootstrap or delegated grant could hijack an operation the primary session
  itself already authorized and 401. The primary session is now registered as a
  synthetic highest-trust (`provenance: "primary"`) runtime grant built from the
  raw SIWE recap (full owner-scoped space URIs, so owners can never be conflated),
  and grant selection filters covering grants then prefers the primary. Spaces the
  node skipped activating this sign-in are excluded from the synthetic grant so it
  can never out-rank a working grant. The synthetic primary grant is never exposed
  through `getRuntimePermissionDelegations`/`hasRuntimePermissions`.

- 3ad0635: Mint the ability the node actually dispatches for SQL/DuckDB
  `execute`/`export`/`describe` (TC-114).

  `SQLService.executeStatementOnDb`/`exportDb` and
  `DuckDbService.executeStatementOnDb`/`describeDb` were sending the literal method
  name as the invocation ability (`tinycloud.sql/execute`,
  `tinycloud.sql/export`, `tinycloud.duckdb/execute`, `tinycloud.duckdb/describe`).
  The node has no such capabilities — it routes these requests by request-body
  kind gated by read/write/admin — so under chain containment a narrowly-delegated
  session (read+write, no `sql/*`/`duckdb/*` wildcard) 401s on these calls. They
  worked previously only because real grants carry the service wildcard.

  Each method now mints the dispatchable ability grounded in the node's routing:
  `export`/`describe` are authorized as reads (`tinycloud.{sql,duckdb}/read`) and
  named-statement execution as a write (`tinycloud.{sql,duckdb}/write`, which the
  SQL parser accepts for both read-only and mutating statements). Public method
  signatures and the exported `SQLAction`/`DuckDbAction` request-kind constants are
  unchanged. Narrowly-delegated sessions with no service wildcard now get working
  `export`, `executeStatement`, and `describe`.

- e07823b: Bump the tinycloud-node WASM-build pin to the v1.4.5 release tag and re-vendor
  the capability registry artifact (TC-119 / TC-121).

  `packages/sdk-rs/Cargo.toml` now pins `tinycloud-sdk-rs`/`tinycloud-sdk-wasm` to
  `tag = "v1.4.5"` (was `v1.4.2`). v1.4.5 is the first release that both contains
  the TC-112 capability registry AND wires it into the live `/invoke`//`/delegate`
  chain-containment paths (TC-119: alias/implication-aware delegation and
  invocation models). Unlike the v1.4.2 pin — where the registry was decoupled and
  the compiled WASM was unaffected — the WASM compiled from this pin genuinely
  changes (the `tinycloud-auth` crate it links in gained the W1 UCAN revocation
  handling shipped across v1.4.3–v1.4.5), so the published `web-sdk-wasm`/
  `node-sdk-wasm` binaries move.

  The vendored `@tinycloud/bootstrap` registry
  (`src/generated/capabilities.ts`) is re-vendored byte-identical from
  tinycloud-node@v1.4.5; the registry CONTENT (`REGISTRY_SOURCE_SHA256`,
  `CAPABILITIES`, `ALIASES`, `IMPLICATIONS`) is unchanged — only the new
  TC-121 `REGISTRY_SOURCE_REPO`/`REGISTRY_SOURCE_GIT_SHA` header exports and their
  doc comments are added. The capabilities-sync CI now anchors its fetch-and-diff
  to the explicit release-tag commit (`ANCHOR_NODE_REV`) rather than the header
  sha (which, for a locally-generated artifact, names the generation parent and
  would fetch the wrong artifact).

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b554d6: Add shared account APIs for applications and delegations, expose them from the node and web SDK clients, and add the `tc account` CLI command group.
- 75bebb1: Add account registry write-through indexing, account space registry APIs, and matching `tc account spaces` / `tc account index status` CLI commands.

  Manifest registration now records an indexed manifest hash and skips durable KV rewrites when the indexed record is current. Sign-in schedules best-effort background registry sync for application manifests and accessible spaces, while every discovered or hosted space is written through to the account registry index.

- 0e8ccc6: Add `TinyCloudNode.hostOwnedSpace(name)` and wire `tc space create`/`tc space host` to it.

  Hosting an owned space (e.g. `applications`) by name now registers it on the server via the host-SIWE delegation flow, so subsequent KV/SQL writes to that space succeed instead of returning `404 - Space not found`. Unlike the internal `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted`, this always submits the host delegation rather than inferring hosting from session activation — a space the current session has never referenced is reported neither `activated` nor `skipped`, which previously caused the host to be silently skipped. The host SIWE is idempotent server-side, so re-hosting an existing space is a safe no-op.

  The `tc space create <name>` command (which previously POSTed the unsupported `tinycloud.space/create` action and failed with `401 Unauthorized`) now hosts the caller's owned space; `tc space host <name>` is added as an alias.

- 934534d: Auth/hosting developer experience for the delegate-asks-owner-to-host model.
  - **`tc space host-request <name> --emit <file>`** (delegate-only): emits a `tinycloud.host.request` artifact naming the space and its resolved owner DID so an agent can surface it to the owner, who then runs `tc space host <name>`. If the caller IS the root authority of the resolved space, it refuses (`ALREADY_ROOT_AUTHORITY`) and tells them to host directly — no request is emitted. The command is a pure local emit and never contacts the node.
  - **Identity-aware `SPACE_NOT_HOSTED`**: an unhosted-space write/read previously surfaced as an opaque `404 - Space not found`. The kv and sql commands now normalize **only** that exact condition (404 + "Space not found" body) to a `SPACE_NOT_HOSTED` error carrying an identity-aware `hint`. The branch key `is_root_authority(space, active session)` is computed locally from the profile address + space DID (no network): the owner is told to run `tc space host <name>`, a delegate is told they cannot host and to emit `tc space host-request <name> --emit`. A wrong db/table/path or permission error is left untouched. A `delegate-session` profile is never treated as the root authority even when its stored ownerDid is the space owner, so a delegate always gets the host-request hint. `KVService` get/head/delete now preserve the `Space not found` 404 body (previously collapsed to `KV_NOT_FOUND` before the body was read), so unhosted-space **reads** normalize too, while a genuine missing key still reports `KV_NOT_FOUND`.
  - **SDK `grantAuthRequest(authority, request, options?)`** (`@tinycloud/node-sdk`): takes a delegation request artifact and returns a grant artifact (`tinycloud.auth.delegation`) by signing through `delegateTo`, so the request→grant handshake is callable programmatically. `tc auth grant` is now a thin wrapper over it. Adds the `AuthRequestArtifact`, `AuthDelegationArtifact`, and `DelegationAuthority` types.

- eb44380: `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted` now consults the account spaces registry before hosting

  Previously `TinyCloudNode.ensureOwnedSpaceHosted(name)` always delegated to
  `hostOwnedSpace`, which unconditionally submits the host-SIWE delegation. Owners
  who already had the space hosted (e.g. a git-haiku owner re-running TinyCloud
  Secrets setup) were therefore prompted to "host" their `secrets` space on every
  run.

  `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted` now resolves the owned space id and first checks the
  account spaces registry: the fast SQLite index (`account.index.spaces.list()`)
  as a best-effort short-circuit, falling back to the canonical, recap-readable KV
  record `account/spaces/{space_id}` (`account.spaces.get`). If the space is
  already registered/hosted it returns the id WITHOUT submitting a host delegation
  (no redundant signature). Only when the space is absent — or the registry check
  fails in any way (e.g. a cold index reporting `no such table: spaces`) — does it
  fall through to `hostOwnedSpace`. After hosting it durably write-through
  registers the space so subsequent calls short-circuit on the registry.

  `hostOwnedSpace` (always-host) is unchanged for callers that explicitly want it.
  The KV path is used rather than `syncAccessible()` because a manifest/recap
  session can read `account/spaces/` under the recap but does not hold
  `tinycloud.space/list`.

- 27f97d8: Add a public `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted(name)` method to `TinyCloudNode` and `TinyCloudWeb` for hosting an owner's owned space (e.g. `"secrets"`) from a session created with a manifest / capabilityRequest.

  A full-authority sign-in auto-hosts the owner's `secrets` space, but a session created with a manifest / capabilityRequest does not. Such a session could hold valid `tinycloud.kv/*` capabilities for the owned `secrets` space yet still fail its first scoped `secrets.put(...)` with `404 Space not found`, because the space was never registered on the node. `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted(name)` resolves the name to the owner's owned-space URI and hosts it via the host-SIWE delegation flow (one signature, idempotent server-side), so subsequent scoped secret writes succeed.

- aa050d1: Resolve and rehydrate `tinycloudHosts` on restored sessions.

  A restored session never resolved its TinyCloud hosts: the restore path
  rehydrated the delegation/address/chainId but never set the hosts, and the
  hosts a session was created with weren't persisted. The first kv/secrets/
  space/encryption call on a restored session therefore threw "TinyCloud
  hosts have not been resolved. Call signIn() first." (notably when
  `signIn()` short-circuited to a restored session).

  Fix (three parts):
  - Persist the hosts: `PersistedSessionData` gains an optional
    `tinycloudHosts` field (back-compat — old persisted sessions still
    validate), and both sign-in save paths write the just-resolved hosts.
  - Rehydrate on restore: `TinyCloudNode.restoreSession` accepts the
    persisted `tinycloudHosts`, adopts them for the service context and the
    auth layer (`setRestoredTinyCloudSession`), and the web SDK threads the
    field through `restoreDataFromPersisted`.
  - Lazy fallback: sessions persisted before this field re-resolve their
    hosts lazily (registry → `node.tinycloud.xyz` fallback) on the first
    host-needing call, exactly like a fresh sign-in. Resolution failures
    surface rather than being masked.

  A restored session now targets the same node as the original sign-in, so
  apps no longer need to pass `tinycloudHosts` explicitly or call
  `clearPersistedSession()` before sign-in.

### Patch Changes

- 0d397a8: Treat the account SQLite index as a materialized cache for user-facing account reads. Account application, space, and delegation list calls can now prefer the index while falling back to canonical account data when index tables are missing or empty, and account writes no longer fail when a best-effort index update fails.
- 895804a: Include `tinycloud.sql/ddl` in the implicit account registry index permission and legacy default SQL grant so account registry writes can create their SQLite tables and indexes on first use. SQL execute and batch calls now sign DDL statements with `tinycloud.sql/ddl`, and mixed batches sign with every required SQL action instead of collapsing to write-only.
- 6622043: Expose `account.index.ensure()` and `tc account index ensure` for lightweight account SQLite schema bootstrap, and start schema bootstrap with background account registry sync.
- 79dd26c: Add the canonical account bootstrap manifest package, shared bootstrap schemas/allowlist, OpenKey callback signing strategy, and first-sign-in SDK bootstrap orchestration for enshrined spaces.
- 08e292d: Thread `invokeAny` into `DelegatedAccess` so delegated sessions can form multi-action SQL invocations. `DelegatedAccess` previously built its `ServiceContext` with only the single-action `invoke`, so any SQL operation needing more than one action in a single `/invoke` — e.g. the migration runner's `ensureMigrationsTable`, which bundles a `CREATE TABLE` schema action with the tracking-row `write` — threw `SQL operation requires multiple permissions ... but this SDK runtime does not support multi-resource invocations`. `DelegatedAccess` now accepts an optional `invokeAny`, and both `TinyCloudNode` construction sites pass `wasmBindings.invokeAny`, mirroring how the top-level node session already wires it.
- 7c5fe21: Automatically ensure owner-owned encryption networks exist during manifest-driven sign-in. When a requested `tinycloud.encryption/decrypt` permission targets the signed-in user's network ID, the SDK adds a separate scoped `tinycloud.encryption/network.create` sign-in grant and `signIn()` creates the network if the node reports it missing.
- 8e8f7e8: Fix runtime permission grants silently failing to match across EIP-155 address-case differences.

  `TinyCloudNode.operationCovers` compared a runtime grant's `spaceId` against the requested operation's `spaceId` byte-for-byte. Stored runtime delegations (e.g. from `tc auth request --grant`, replayed on every node create) keep the EIP-55 **checksummed** address, while a space URI built by the CLI is **lowercased** — so a valid granted capability never matched and the invocation fell back to the base session, surfacing as a spurious `401 AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED` ("active session missing capability") even though `tc auth caps` showed the cap.

  Ethereum addresses are case-insensitive; space comparison now lowercases ONLY the `eip155:<chain>:0x<addr>` address segment before comparing, leaving the case-sensitive space NAME byte-exact. This is the runtime-grant analogue of the CLI-layer `OPENKEY_SCOPE_MISMATCH` fix (`normalizeSpaceForCompare`).

- fa4a7c7: Add regression coverage for SQL migration batches that require both `tinycloud.sql/ddl` and `tinycloud.sql/write`, including the legacy-session runtime permission repair path used by TinyCloud Secrets.
- d4a0a69: Add a SQL migrations helper on database handles: `sql.db(name).migrations.apply({ namespace, migrations })`. The helper records applied migration ids in a TinyCloud-managed table, signs migration DDL/write/read actions through the SQL service, and returns whether migrations were applied or already current.

  The account registry index now uses the migrations helper for its schema setup, and SQL/DuckDB service errors sanitize non-JSON proxy HTML pages into concise retryable messages while preserving a bounded debug snippet in error metadata.

- a22a7f0: Rename the SDK-emitted SQL schema-change permission from `tinycloud.sql/ddl` to `tinycloud.sql/schema`, including manifest defaults and account-registry grants.

  TinyCloudWeb now treats a restored persisted session as stale when it does not cover the currently configured manifest permissions, then runs the normal manifest sign-in flow instead of letting apps request those manifest permissions separately after login.

- 42f1235: Add an opt-in TinyCloud debug logger controlled by `TinyCloud_debug`. The logger keeps a 1000-event in-memory ring buffer, writes structured events to `console.debug` when enabled, exposes browser console helpers for enabling, disabling, inspecting, and clearing logs, persists browser debug mode through `localStorage`, and captures service events plus `fetch`, `invoke`, and `invokeAny` timings.
- b6c3fd8: Fix wallet-mode `useDelegation` dropping every resource except the top-level one. A multi-resource delegation (e.g. `[{tinycloud.kv get vault/secrets/X}, {tinycloud.encryption decrypt <networkId>}]`) carries each grant in `delegation.resources[]`, but the flat top-level `path`/`actions` mirror only the first resource. `useDelegation` built the activation sub-delegation's abilities from those flat fields alone, so for multi-resource delegations every other resource was silently dropped — the activated session held only the encryption cap and a subsequent `access.kv.get(...)` failed with `Unauthorized Action: .../tinycloud.kv/get`. Wallet-mode `useDelegation` now builds the activated abilities from the full `resources[]` set (kv/sql/duckdb scoped to the delegation space, encryption network URNs as raw abilities), so one `useDelegation` call grants every resource's capabilities.

  Also export the type-only barrel names `WasmKeyProviderConfig` and `NodeUserAuthorizationConfig` as `export type`, so importing node-sdk as raw TypeScript (e.g. via bun) no longer throws `SyntaxError: export 'X' not found`.

### Minor Changes

- eb44380: `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted` now consults the account spaces registry before hosting

  Previously `TinyCloudNode.ensureOwnedSpaceHosted(name)` always delegated to
  `hostOwnedSpace`, which unconditionally submits the host-SIWE delegation. Owners
  who already had the space hosted (e.g. a git-haiku owner re-running TinyCloud
  Secrets setup) were therefore prompted to "host" their `secrets` space on every
  run.

  `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted` now resolves the owned space id and first checks the
  account spaces registry: the fast SQLite index (`account.index.spaces.list()`)
  as a best-effort short-circuit, falling back to the canonical, recap-readable KV
  record `account/spaces/{space_id}` (`account.spaces.get`). If the space is
  already registered/hosted it returns the id WITHOUT submitting a host delegation
  (no redundant signature). Only when the space is absent — or the registry check
  fails in any way (e.g. a cold index reporting `no such table: spaces`) — does it
  fall through to `hostOwnedSpace`. After hosting it durably write-through
  registers the space so subsequent calls short-circuit on the registry.

  `hostOwnedSpace` (always-host) is unchanged for callers that explicitly want it.
  The KV path is used rather than `syncAccessible()` because a manifest/recap
  session can read `account/spaces/` under the recap but does not hold
  `tinycloud.space/list`.

## 2.4.0-beta.11

### Minor Changes

- aa050d1: Resolve and rehydrate `tinycloudHosts` on restored sessions.

  A restored session never resolved its TinyCloud hosts: the restore path
  rehydrated the delegation/address/chainId but never set the hosts, and the
  hosts a session was created with weren't persisted. The first kv/secrets/
  space/encryption call on a restored session therefore threw "TinyCloud
  hosts have not been resolved. Call signIn() first." (notably when
  `signIn()` short-circuited to a restored session).

  Fix (three parts):
  - Persist the hosts: `PersistedSessionData` gains an optional
    `tinycloudHosts` field (back-compat — old persisted sessions still
    validate), and both sign-in save paths write the just-resolved hosts.
  - Rehydrate on restore: `TinyCloudNode.restoreSession` accepts the
    persisted `tinycloudHosts`, adopts them for the service context and the
    auth layer (`setRestoredTinyCloudSession`), and the web SDK threads the
    field through `restoreDataFromPersisted`.
  - Lazy fallback: sessions persisted before this field re-resolve their
    hosts lazily (registry → `node.tinycloud.xyz` fallback) on the first
    host-needing call, exactly like a fresh sign-in. Resolution failures
    surface rather than being masked.

  A restored session now targets the same node as the original sign-in, so
  apps no longer need to pass `tinycloudHosts` explicitly or call
  `clearPersistedSession()` before sign-in.

### Patch Changes

  - @tinycloud/sdk-core@2.4.0-beta.11

## 2.4.0-beta.10

### Minor Changes

- 27f97d8: Add a public `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted(name)` method to `TinyCloudNode` and `TinyCloudWeb` for hosting an owner's owned space (e.g. `"secrets"`) from a session created with a manifest / capabilityRequest.

  A full-authority sign-in auto-hosts the owner's `secrets` space, but a session created with a manifest / capabilityRequest does not. Such a session could hold valid `tinycloud.kv/*` capabilities for the owned `secrets` space yet still fail its first scoped `secrets.put(...)` with `404 Space not found`, because the space was never registered on the node. `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted(name)` resolves the name to the owner's owned-space URI and hosts it via the host-SIWE delegation flow (one signature, idempotent server-side), so subsequent scoped secret writes succeed.

### Patch Changes

- d4a0a69: Add a SQL migrations helper on database handles: `sql.db(name).migrations.apply({ namespace, migrations })`. The helper records applied migration ids in a TinyCloud-managed table, signs migration DDL/write/read actions through the SQL service, and returns whether migrations were applied or already current.

  The account registry index now uses the migrations helper for its schema setup, and SQL/DuckDB service errors sanitize non-JSON proxy HTML pages into concise retryable messages while preserving a bounded debug snippet in error metadata.

## 2.4.0-beta.7

### Minor Changes

- 75bebb1: Add account registry write-through indexing, account space registry APIs, and matching `tc account spaces` / `tc account index status` CLI commands.

  Manifest registration now records an indexed manifest hash and skips durable KV rewrites when the indexed record is current. Sign-in schedules best-effort background registry sync for application manifests and accessible spaces, while every discovered or hosted space is written through to the account registry index.

## 2.4.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- 8e8f7e8: Fix runtime permission grants silently failing to match across EIP-155 address-case differences.

  `TinyCloudNode.operationCovers` compared a runtime grant's `spaceId` against the requested operation's `spaceId` byte-for-byte. Stored runtime delegations (e.g. from `tc auth request --grant`, replayed on every node create) keep the EIP-55 **checksummed** address, while a space URI built by the CLI is **lowercased** — so a valid granted capability never matched and the invocation fell back to the base session, surfacing as a spurious `401 AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED` ("active session missing capability") even though `tc auth caps` showed the cap.

  Ethereum addresses are case-insensitive; space comparison now lowercases ONLY the `eip155:<chain>:0x<addr>` address segment before comparing, leaving the case-sensitive space NAME byte-exact. This is the runtime-grant analogue of the CLI-layer `OPENKEY_SCOPE_MISMATCH` fix (`normalizeSpaceForCompare`).

## 2.4.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- 934534d: Auth/hosting developer experience for the delegate-asks-owner-to-host model.
  - **`tc space host-request <name> --emit <file>`** (delegate-only): emits a `tinycloud.host.request` artifact naming the space and its resolved owner DID so an agent can surface it to the owner, who then runs `tc space host <name>`. If the caller IS the root authority of the resolved space, it refuses (`ALREADY_ROOT_AUTHORITY`) and tells them to host directly — no request is emitted. The command is a pure local emit and never contacts the node.
  - **Identity-aware `SPACE_NOT_HOSTED`**: an unhosted-space write/read previously surfaced as an opaque `404 - Space not found`. The kv and sql commands now normalize **only** that exact condition (404 + "Space not found" body) to a `SPACE_NOT_HOSTED` error carrying an identity-aware `hint`. The branch key `is_root_authority(space, active session)` is computed locally from the profile address + space DID (no network): the owner is told to run `tc space host <name>`, a delegate is told they cannot host and to emit `tc space host-request <name> --emit`. A wrong db/table/path or permission error is left untouched. A `delegate-session` profile is never treated as the root authority even when its stored ownerDid is the space owner, so a delegate always gets the host-request hint. `KVService` get/head/delete now preserve the `Space not found` 404 body (previously collapsed to `KV_NOT_FOUND` before the body was read), so unhosted-space **reads** normalize too, while a genuine missing key still reports `KV_NOT_FOUND`.
  - **SDK `grantAuthRequest(authority, request, options?)`** (`@tinycloud/node-sdk`): takes a delegation request artifact and returns a grant artifact (`tinycloud.auth.delegation`) by signing through `delegateTo`, so the request→grant handshake is callable programmatically. `tc auth grant` is now a thin wrapper over it. Adds the `AuthRequestArtifact`, `AuthDelegationArtifact`, and `DelegationAuthority` types.

### Patch Changes

- @tinycloud/sdk-core@2.4.0-beta.2

## 2.4.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- 0e8ccc6: Add `TinyCloudNode.hostOwnedSpace(name)` and wire `tc space create`/`tc space host` to it.

  Hosting an owned space (e.g. `applications`) by name now registers it on the server via the host-SIWE delegation flow, so subsequent KV/SQL writes to that space succeed instead of returning `404 - Space not found`. Unlike the internal `ensureOwnedSpaceHosted`, this always submits the host delegation rather than inferring hosting from session activation — a space the current session has never referenced is reported neither `activated` nor `skipped`, which previously caused the host to be silently skipped. The host SIWE is idempotent server-side, so re-hosting an existing space is a safe no-op.

  The `tc space create <name>` command (which previously POSTed the unsupported `tinycloud.space/create` action and failed with `401 Unauthorized`) now hosts the caller's owned space; `tc space host <name>` is added as an alias.

### Patch Changes

## 2.3.1-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- b6c3fd8: Fix wallet-mode `useDelegation` dropping every resource except the top-level one. A multi-resource delegation (e.g. `[{tinycloud.kv get vault/secrets/X}, {tinycloud.encryption decrypt <networkId>}]`) carries each grant in `delegation.resources[]`, but the flat top-level `path`/`actions` mirror only the first resource. `useDelegation` built the activation sub-delegation's abilities from those flat fields alone, so for multi-resource delegations every other resource was silently dropped — the activated session held only the encryption cap and a subsequent `access.kv.get(...)` failed with `Unauthorized Action: .../tinycloud.kv/get`. Wallet-mode `useDelegation` now builds the activated abilities from the full `resources[]` set (kv/sql/duckdb scoped to the delegation space, encryption network URNs as raw abilities), so one `useDelegation` call grants every resource's capabilities.

### Patch Changes

- 9ee7404: Harden encryption-network decrypt flows, add CLI secrets coverage, and fix web WASM initialization.
- a92819d: Add canonical EVM address and `did:pkh:eip155` helpers, then use them when building and comparing TinyCloud DIDs and space IDs.
- 90bdc18: Add canonical encryption network ID helpers so apps can compare network-scoped capabilities across equivalent owner DID address casing.
- 9550c18: Add CLI auth artifact handoff flows for owner/delegate workflows.

  `tc auth request` now emits and stores a `tinycloud.auth.request` artifact by
  default, with `--grant` preserving the immediate grant behavior. Profiles now
  track canonical posture/operator metadata so a local key, OpenKey owner, or
  delegate session can be represented explicitly.

  New commands:
  - `tc auth grant <request>` consumes a request artifact as an owner profile and
    emits a `tinycloud.auth.delegation` artifact to stdout. Local-key owner
    grants can use `--yes` for non-interactive approval.
  - `tc auth import <artifact>` installs delegation artifacts and preserves their
    originating request id.
  - `tc auth retry <requestId|--last> --exec` reruns the captured command once the
    requested permissions are covered.

  Local-key CLI profiles now persist and restore their TinyCloud session key
  identity so request artifacts target the same session key that later imports the
  delegation. `@tinycloud/node-sdk` now accepts runtime delegations targeted at the
  fragmentless form of the current session DID (`did:key:...`) as equivalent to
  the session verification method DID URL (`did:key:...#...`).

- ddab8fa: Add `TinyCloudNode.kvForSpace(spaceId)` and a `--space` option on `tc kv get/list/head`, mirroring the existing `sqlForSpace` / `tc sql --space`. This lets KV reads target a non-primary space — e.g. reading a manifest app's data kept under the owner's `applications` space (such as Listen's transcripts at `applications/kv/<app-id>/transcript/<id>`) when the session already holds a covering delegation.
- d606baf: Accept equivalent `did:pkh:eip155` owner DID address casing when validating encryption network descriptors, including legacy `principal` descriptors, so `tc secrets` can read existing network metadata. Pin the Rust WASM source to the released `tinycloud-node` `v1.4.2` tag.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 0401ff8: Add default TinyCloud host discovery and run it from sign-in when no explicit host is configured.
- 9ff4b34: Introduce `EXPIRY` tiers as the single source of truth for default
  delegation lifetimes. Pick a tier, not a number, when adding a new
  delegation surface.

  The delegation tiers and signed URL TTL, exported from `@tinycloud/sdk-core`:
  - `EXPIRY.EPHEMERAL_MS` (1h) — auto-refreshable, never user-visible.
  - `EXPIRY.SIGNED_READ_URL_MS` (5m) — short-lived bearer KV read URLs.
  - `EXPIRY.SESSION_MS` (7d) — sign-in sessions and runtime grants
    (capped by session anyway).
  - `EXPIRY.SHARE_MS` (7d) — share links and ad-hoc third-party
    delegations.
  - `EXPIRY.APP_MS` (30d) — manifest-declared installs.
  - `EXPIRY.MAX_MS` (10y) — caller-supplied upper bound.

  Behavior changes:
  - **`SharingService` share-link default: 24h → 7d.** Same direction as
    the runtime-grant default that already shipped at 7d. Callers passing
    explicit expiry are unaffected.
  - **`DelegationManager.create()` default: 24h → 7d** when the caller
    omits `expiry`.
  - **`SpaceService` server-response fallback: 24h → 7d** when the
    server's delegation response lacks an `expiry` field.
  - **`NodeUserAuthorization.sessionExpirationMs` default: 1h → 7d.**
    Fixes a silent inconsistency where direct `NodeUserAuthorization`
    consumers got 1h while `TinyCloudNode` users got 7d.
  - **`TinyCloudNode` public-space sub-delegation: 1h** (unchanged value,
    re-tagged as `EPHEMERAL` to make the intent legible — these are
    re-derived transparently on every public-space touch).

  Sites unchanged in value but re-pointed at tiered constants:
  - `TinyCloudNode.DEFAULT_SESSION_EXPIRATION_MS` → `EXPIRY.SESSION_MS`
  - `delegateToHelpers.DEFAULT_DELEGATION_EXPIRY_MS` → `EXPIRY.SESSION_MS`
  - `manifest.DEFAULT_EXPIRY` (`"30d"`) — still ms-format string for
    parser compatibility, comment now points at `EXPIRY.APP_MS`.

- 9ff4b34: Default delegation lifetime bumped to 7 days; default session lifetime
  bumped to 7 days; CLI gains `tc auth request --expiry`.

  Why: 1-hour grants forced agent workflows to re-prompt the user for caps
  they had already approved on every CLI invocation past the first hour.
  The session itself defaulted to 1 hour too, so even an explicit
  `--expiry 30d` couldn't outlive its parent. Both defaults moved to 7
  days so the common agent loop runs unattended for a week.
  - `delegateToHelpers.resolveExpiryMs(undefined)` now returns
    `DEFAULT_DELEGATION_EXPIRY_MS = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`.
  - `TinyCloudNodeConfig.sessionExpirationMs` default is now
    `DEFAULT_SESSION_EXPIRATION_MS = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`. Existing
    callers passing an explicit value are unaffected. Wallet-mode SIWE
    sessions cap at 1 hour by protocol — that limit is independent of
    this default.
  - `tc auth request --expiry <duration>` accepts a ms-format string
    (`"7d"`, `"30m"`) or raw millisecond integer. Forwarded to
    `node.grantRuntimePermissions(permissions, { expiry })` for the
    local-key path and encoded into the OpenKey `/delegate?expiry=...`
    URL parameter for the OpenKey path. OpenKey-side support landed
    separately in TinyCloudLabs/openkey.

- 6561589: Add manifest v1 composition helpers, per-space capability requests, materialized manifest delegations, and the default account-space application registry grant.
- 010ee0f: Fix `restoreSession` so runtime-permission-grant operations work after
  session restore (notably the OpenKey-backed CLI path).

  `TinyCloudNode.restoreSession` populated `_serviceContext.session` (the
  `ServiceSession` used by service invokers) but never set
  `auth.tinyCloudSession` (the richer `TinyCloudSession` that surfaces the
  SIWE recap, address, chain, etc.). Methods that read from the latter —
  `hasRuntimePermissions`, `getRuntimePermissionDelegations`,
  `useRuntimeDelegation`, `grantRuntimePermissions` — therefore threw
  `SessionExpiredError(new Date(0))` immediately after every restore.

  Symptoms:
  - `tc auth request --cap …` fails with `Session expired at 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`
  - Persisted runtime delegations replayed via `useRuntimeDelegation` are
    rejected, so `tc auth caps` reports `granted: []` even when
    `additional-delegations.json` has live entries.

  Changes:
  - `restoreSession` now accepts optional `siwe` and `signature` fields.
  - When `siwe` + `address` + `chainId` are provided, a full
    `TinyCloudSession` is rehydrated. In wallet mode it lands on
    `auth.tinyCloudSession` via the new
    `NodeUserAuthorization.setRestoredTinyCloudSession`. In session-only
    mode (no auth layer — typical for OpenKey-restored CLIs) it lands on
    a new `TinyCloudNode._restoredTcSession` field.
  - A new private `currentTinyCloudSession()` helper resolves the active
    session from either surface. The four runtime-permission readers
    (`hasRuntimePermissions`, `getRuntimePermissionDelegations`,
    `useRuntimeDelegation`, `grantRuntimePermissions`) now consult it.

  CLI side (`@tinycloud/cli`): `replayAdditionalDelegations` exposes a
  `TC_DEBUG_REPLAY=1` env switch that prints which stored delegations
  fail to install and why. Useful for diagnosing future restore-related
  issues.

  Backwards compatible: `restoreSession`'s new parameters are optional;
  old callers continue to work, they just don't get runtime-grant
  support until they pass `siwe`. The CLI was already passing `siwe` —
  the SDK was just dropping it.

- 8367cef: Store approved runtime permissions as narrow portable delegations and route matching invocations through them instead of expanding the app manifest and re-signing the whole session. `delegateTo()` can now derive from an installed runtime delegation, web permission requests return any created runtime delegations, and the secrets wrapper can use the SDK's connected signer when unlocking the backing vault.
- 35212bb: Add canonical scoped secret support. Manifest `secrets` entries now accept object specs with `scope` and optional `name`, and `tc.secrets` supports scoped `get`, `put`, `delete`, and `list` calls using the canonical `secrets/scoped/<scope>/<NAME>` vault layout.
- 46f126a: Add manifest `secrets` declarations and SDK helpers backed by the secrets space vault, including read-default permissions and write/delete escalation.
- f43143d: TC-1372: add `kv.createSignedReadUrl()` for minting short-lived signed KV read URLs through tinycloud-node's `/signed/kv` endpoint.

  The method signs a normal `tinycloud.kv/get` invocation for the resolved key path, posts the signed URL request to tinycloud-node, and returns an absolute URL plus the opaque ticket id and expiry metadata. Requires tinycloud-node with the TC-1368 signed KV URL API.

  The default signed read URL expiry is defined in `sdk-core` as
  `EXPIRY.SIGNED_READ_URL_MS` and exposed as
  `DEFAULT_SIGNED_READ_URL_EXPIRY_MS`.

- 78ef7eb: Add `tinycloud.vault` as an SDK permission shorthand that expands to the backing KV permissions used by encrypted vault operations, including runtime permission escalation.

### Patch Changes

- 9ab4644: Check whether the manifest account registry space already exists before hosting it during sign-in, avoiding repeated account-space host prompts.
- 9ff4b34: CLI: agent-friendly permission management and cross-space SQL.
  - `tc auth request` requests additional runtime permissions via the SDK's
    `grantRuntimePermissions` flow. Accepts `--cap <spec>`, `--permission <file>`,
    or `--manifest <fileOrBase64>`. OpenKey path forwards the requested entries
    through the `/delegate` URL so the consent UI shows what's being asked for.
  - `tc auth caps` lists appended runtime delegations and their granted
    capabilities. `--diff <spec>` reports whether the active session covers a
    capability without granting it. `--history` shows the audit log.
  - `tc manifest resolve <fileOrUrl>` is a read-only diagnostic that prints the
    effective space URI, capability paths, and SQL database basenames for an
    app manifest.
  - `tc sql query|execute|export --space <name|uri>` routes through a
    per-space SQL service so non-primary-space data is reachable. Backed by a
    new `TinyCloudNode.sqlForSpace(spaceId)` helper that mirrors the per-space
    KV factory pattern.
  - `tc sql copy --from-space S --from-db D --to-space S2 --to-db D2 [--table T...] [--dry-run]`
    copies rows between databases (optionally across spaces). Refuses self-copy.
  - AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED errors emit a copy-pasteable
    `tc auth request --cap "..."` hint derived from the unauthorized resource
    and required action.
  - NETWORK_ERROR emits a hint listing alternate profiles and their hosts when
    the active profile's host is unreachable.
  - `ProfileConfig.openkeyHost` (or `TC_OPENKEY_HOST` env var) overrides the
    OpenKey base URL per profile, enabling self-hosted or local OpenKey
    deployments for testing accounts. Default unchanged.
  - Persists appended runtime delegations alongside the existing session in
    `~/.tinycloud/profiles/<p>/additional-delegations.json` and replays them
    via `useRuntimeDelegation()` on next CLI invocation. Grants logged to
    `auth-grants.jsonl`.

  node-sdk: adds `TinyCloudNode.sqlForSpace(spaceId): ISQLService` so callers
  that already hold a delegation covering a non-primary space can issue SQL
  queries without restoring a fresh session.

- 04a0d5c: Expose `DelegatedAccess.restorable` — a read-only projection of the activated session handles (`delegationHeader`, `delegationCid`, `spaceId`, `jwk`, `verificationMethod`, `address`, `chainId`) in the exact shape `TinyCloudNode.restoreSession(...)` consumes. Enables persisting a `useDelegation` activation across processes or restarts (e.g. agent runtimes that want vanilla `@tinycloud/cli` to operate against a delegated space). Note: in wallet mode the header/cid are minted against the activator's server-side session and expire with it (~1h), so callers must periodically re-run `useDelegation` + `restoreSession`.
- b9a24b5: Add implicit space-level `tinycloud.capabilities/read` grants for every space touched by a manifest request.

## 2.2.0-beta.11

### Minor Changes

- 9ff4b34: Introduce `EXPIRY` tiers as the single source of truth for default
  delegation lifetimes. Pick a tier, not a number, when adding a new
  delegation surface.

  The five tiers, exported from `@tinycloud/sdk-core`:
  - `EXPIRY.EPHEMERAL_MS` (1h) — auto-refreshable, never user-visible.
  - `EXPIRY.SESSION_MS` (7d) — sign-in sessions and runtime grants
    (capped by session anyway).
  - `EXPIRY.SHARE_MS` (7d) — share links and ad-hoc third-party
    delegations.
  - `EXPIRY.APP_MS` (30d) — manifest-declared installs.
  - `EXPIRY.MAX_MS` (10y) — caller-supplied upper bound.

  Behavior changes:
  - **`SharingService` share-link default: 24h → 7d.** Same direction as
    the runtime-grant default that already shipped at 7d. Callers passing
    explicit expiry are unaffected.
  - **`DelegationManager.create()` default: 24h → 7d** when the caller
    omits `expiry`.
  - **`SpaceService` server-response fallback: 24h → 7d** when the
    server's delegation response lacks an `expiry` field.
  - **`NodeUserAuthorization.sessionExpirationMs` default: 1h → 7d.**
    Fixes a silent inconsistency where direct `NodeUserAuthorization`
    consumers got 1h while `TinyCloudNode` users got 7d.
  - **`TinyCloudNode` public-space sub-delegation: 1h** (unchanged value,
    re-tagged as `EPHEMERAL` to make the intent legible — these are
    re-derived transparently on every public-space touch).

  Sites unchanged in value but re-pointed at tiered constants:
  - `TinyCloudNode.DEFAULT_SESSION_EXPIRATION_MS` → `EXPIRY.SESSION_MS`
  - `delegateToHelpers.DEFAULT_DELEGATION_EXPIRY_MS` → `EXPIRY.SESSION_MS`
  - `manifest.DEFAULT_EXPIRY` (`"30d"`) — still ms-format string for
    parser compatibility, comment now points at `EXPIRY.APP_MS`.

- 9ff4b34: Default delegation lifetime bumped to 7 days; default session lifetime
  bumped to 7 days; CLI gains `tc auth request --expiry`.

  Why: 1-hour grants forced agent workflows to re-prompt the user for caps
  they had already approved on every CLI invocation past the first hour.

    sessions cap at 1 hour by protocol — that limit is independent of
    this default.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8abfb4e: Bump past stale `2.1.0-beta.0` / `1.7.2-beta.0` ghost versions to publish PR #184's capability-chain delegation code.

  The earlier `2.1.0-beta.0` (TS SDKs) and `1.7.2-beta.0` (WASM) tarballs on npm predate PR #184 and are missing `resolveManifest`, `isCapabilitySubset`, manifest types, and the `parseRecapFromSiwe` re-export. This empty changeset forces `changeset version` to land on the next beta counter so the Beta Release workflow actually publishes the post-#184 code.

  All four TS packages in the linked group are named explicitly so `@tinycloud/sdk-services` advances too (naming only `@tinycloud/sdk-core` left it pinned at the ghost `2.1.0-beta.0`). Both WASM wrappers take a patch bump so the TS SDKs don't pin a stale `@tinycloud/*-sdk-wasm@1.7.2-beta.0`.

- 9dad135: Wire manifest-driven `signIn` and multi-resource `delegateTo` end-to-end (closes the two gaps in `2.1.0-beta.1`).

  `signIn` now reads `config.manifest` and resolves it (via `resolveManifest` + the new `manifestAbilitiesUnion`) into the WASM `abilities` map used by `prepareSession`. The resulting SIWE recap covers the union of the app's own permissions AND every manifest-declared delegation's permissions, so the session key acquires coverage for both runtime use and downstream sub-delegations in one wallet prompt. Apps that don't pass a manifest fall back to `defaultActions` (legacy behaviour, no change).

  `delegateTo(did, permissions)` no longer rejects multi-entry input. The SDK now folds every `(service, path, actions)` entry into a single multi-resource abilities map and calls the WASM `createDelegation` once — producing ONE signed UCAN whose `attenuation` carries every grant. The returned `PortableDelegation` has the new optional `resources?: DelegatedResource[]` field listing the full breakdown; the legacy flat `path` + `actions` fields mirror the first (sorted) resource for back-compat.

  Listen-style apps that needed to delegate KV + SQL on the same prefix to a backend can now do so in a single `tcw.delegateTo(backendDID, [...])` call with no wallet prompt.

  **Breaking changes** — pre-2.1.0-beta.2 callers will need to update:
  - `@tinycloud/sdk-core`: `CreateDelegationWasmParams` swaps `path: string; actions: string[]` for `abilities: Record<string, Record<string, string[]>>`. `CreateDelegationWasmResult` swaps the flat `path` + `actions` for `resources: DelegatedResource[]`. New exports: `DelegatedResource`, `AbilitiesMap`, `manifestAbilitiesUnion`, `resourceCapabilitiesToAbilitiesMap`.
  - `@tinycloud/node-sdk`: `TinyCloudNodeConfig` gains an optional `manifest?: Manifest` field. `TinyCloudNode` gains `setManifest(manifest)` and `manifest` getter passthroughs to the underlying auth handler. `delegateTo` no longer throws on multi-entry input — apps that relied on that behaviour for validation must add their own length check. `PortableDelegation` gains an optional `resources?: DelegatedResource[]` field.
  - `@tinycloud/web-sdk`: `TinyCloudWeb.setManifest()` now forwards the new manifest into the underlying `TinyCloudNode` so the next `signIn()` picks it up. `BrowserWasmBindings.createDelegation` signature aligned with the new WASM ABI.
  - `@tinycloud/node-sdk-wasm` / `@tinycloud/web-sdk-wasm`: the `createDelegation` WASM export takes `abilities: object` (multi-resource map) instead of `path: string, actions: string[]`. The Rust rev in `packages/sdk-rs/Cargo.toml` is bumped to the merge commit of the `feat/create-delegation-multi-resource` PR in `tinycloud-node`.

- 61c031d: Add write-hooks support across the JS SDK surface for SDK services, core, Node, and web packages.

### Patch Changes

- 303a8eb: Add an optional per-call `nonce` override to `signIn()` while preserving constructor-level `siweConfig.nonce` support.
- b88728a: fix(sdk-core): normalize space URI in recap parse for derivability check

  The Rust WASM `parseRecapFromSiwe` returns `space` as the full recap target
  URI (`tinycloud:pkh:eip155:{chainId}:{address}:{name}`), while manifest
  permissions and backend-advertised permissions use the short `{name}` form
  (e.g. `"default"`). `isCapabilitySubset` was doing strict string comparison
  on `space`, so mixing the two forms always failed — `delegateTo` would throw
  `PermissionNotInManifestError` even when the session recap covered every
  requested capability.

  This broke end-to-end manifest-driven sign-in in the listen app, where the
  session SIWE was signed correctly with the union of all manifest abilities
  but `delegateTo(backendDID, info.permissions)` still failed on the subset
  check because `"tinycloud:pkh:eip155:1:0xd559...:default"` and `"default"`
  didn't match as strings.

  Fix: add a `normalizeSpace` helper that extracts the trailing name segment
  from a `tinycloud:` URI. Apply it in `parseRecapCapabilities` (so the output
  is always in short-name form) and defensively in `isCapabilitySubset` on
  both sides (so callers passing either form work transparently).

- c586568: fix(node-sdk): activate WASM-path delegations with the host so downstream consumers can reference the parent CID

  `createDelegationViaWasmPath` (the session-key UCAN fast path used by
  `tcw.delegateTo` when the requested capabilities are derivable from the
  current session) was building the UCAN client-side and returning it
  directly without posting it to the host. This meant the host's delegation
  store never saw the UCAN.

  When a downstream consumer (e.g. a backend calling `node.useDelegation`)
  tried to reference the UCAN's CID as the parent of its own invoker SIWE,
  the host's chain-validation step failed with "Cannot find parent
  delegation" — the host looks up parents by CID in its local database,
  and the client-side-only UCAN was never stored.

  Fix: after computing the UCAN in `createDelegationViaWasmPath`, call
  `activateSessionWithHost` to POST the delegation header to `/delegate`
  before returning the `PortableDelegation`. This mirrors the legacy
  `createDelegationWalletPath` which has done the same for wallet-signed
  SIWE delegations since day one.

- 4fac901: Publish the UCAN delegation header fix from PR #192.

  `createDelegationViaWasmPath` now activates session-key UCAN delegations with
  the raw serialized JWT in the `Authorization` header instead of prefixing it

## 2.1.0-beta.6

### Patch Changes

- 4fac901: Publish the UCAN delegation header fix from PR #192.

  `createDelegationViaWasmPath` now activates session-key UCAN delegations with
  the raw serialized JWT in the `Authorization` header instead of prefixing it
  with `Bearer `. The TinyCloud host decodes this header directly as a UCAN JWT;
  the prefixed value causes host activation to fail with 401 during
  manifest-driven `delegateTo` flows such as TinyBoilerplate/OpenKey sign-in.

## 2.1.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- c586568: fix(node-sdk): activate WASM-path delegations with the host so downstream consumers can reference the parent CID

  `createDelegationViaWasmPath` (the session-key UCAN fast path used by
  `tcw.delegateTo` when the requested capabilities are derivable from the
  current session) was building the UCAN client-side and returning it
  directly without posting it to the host. This meant the host's delegation
  store never saw the UCAN.

  When a downstream consumer (e.g. a backend calling `node.useDelegation`)
  tried to reference the UCAN's CID as the parent of its own invoker SIWE,
  the host's chain-validation step failed with "Cannot find parent
  delegation" — the host looks up parents by CID in its local database,
  and the client-side-only UCAN was never stored.

  Fix: after computing the UCAN in `createDelegationViaWasmPath`, call
  `activateSessionWithHost` to POST the delegation header to `/delegate`
  before returning the `PortableDelegation`. This mirrors the legacy
  `createDelegationWalletPath` which has done the same for wallet-signed
  SIWE delegations since day one.

## 2.1.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- b88728a: fix(sdk-core): normalize space URI in recap parse for derivability check

  The Rust WASM `parseRecapFromSiwe` returns `space` as the full recap target
  URI (`tinycloud:pkh:eip155:{chainId}:{address}:{name}`), while manifest
  permissions and backend-advertised permissions use the short `{name}` form
  (e.g. `"default"`). `isCapabilitySubset` was doing strict string comparison
  on `space`, so mixing the two forms always failed — `delegateTo` would throw
  `PermissionNotInManifestError` even when the session recap covered every
  requested capability.

  This broke end-to-end manifest-driven sign-in in the listen app, where the
  session SIWE was signed correctly with the union of all manifest abilities
  but `delegateTo(backendDID, info.permissions)` still failed on the subset
  check because `"tinycloud:pkh:eip155:1:0xd559...:default"` and `"default"`
  didn't match as strings.

  Fix: add a `normalizeSpace` helper that extracts the trailing name segment
  from a `tinycloud:` URI. Apply it in `parseRecapCapabilities` (so the output
  is always in short-name form) and defensively in `isCapabilitySubset` on
  both sides (so callers passing either form work transparently).

## 2.1.0-beta.2

### Minor Changes

- 9dad135: Wire manifest-driven `signIn` and multi-resource `delegateTo` end-to-end (closes the two gaps in `2.1.0-beta.1`).

  `signIn` now reads `config.manifest` and resolves it (via `resolveManifest` + the new `manifestAbilitiesUnion`) into the WASM `abilities` map used by `prepareSession`. The resulting SIWE recap covers the union of the app's own permissions AND every manifest-declared delegation's permissions, so the session key acquires coverage for both runtime use and downstream sub-delegations in one wallet prompt. Apps that don't pass a manifest fall back to `defaultActions` (legacy behaviour, no change).

  `delegateTo(did, permissions)` no longer rejects multi-entry input. The SDK now folds every `(service, path, actions)` entry into a single multi-resource abilities map and calls the WASM `createDelegation` once — producing ONE signed UCAN whose `attenuation` carries every grant. The returned `PortableDelegation` has the new optional `resources?: DelegatedResource[]` field listing the full breakdown; the legacy flat `path` + `actions` fields mirror the first (sorted) resource for back-compat.

  Listen-style apps that needed to delegate KV + SQL on the same prefix to a backend can now do so in a single `tcw.delegateTo(backendDID, [...])` call with no wallet prompt.

  **Breaking changes** — pre-2.1.0-beta.2 callers will need to update:
  - `@tinycloud/sdk-core`: `CreateDelegationWasmParams` swaps `path: string; actions: string[]` for `abilities: Record<string, Record<string, string[]>>`. `CreateDelegationWasmResult` swaps the flat `path` + `actions` for `resources: DelegatedResource[]`. New exports: `DelegatedResource`, `AbilitiesMap`, `manifestAbilitiesUnion`, `resourceCapabilitiesToAbilitiesMap`.
  - `@tinycloud/node-sdk`: `TinyCloudNodeConfig` gains an optional `manifest?: Manifest` field. `TinyCloudNode` gains `setManifest(manifest)` and `manifest` getter passthroughs to the underlying auth handler. `delegateTo` no longer throws on multi-entry input — apps that relied on that behaviour for validation must add their own length check. `PortableDelegation` gains an optional `resources?: DelegatedResource[]` field.
  - `@tinycloud/web-sdk`: `TinyCloudWeb.setManifest()` now forwards the new manifest into the underlying `TinyCloudNode` so the next `signIn()` picks it up. `BrowserWasmBindings.createDelegation` signature aligned with the new WASM ABI.
  - `@tinycloud/node-sdk-wasm` / `@tinycloud/web-sdk-wasm`: the `createDelegation` WASM export takes `abilities: object` (multi-resource map) instead of `path: string, actions: string[]`. The Rust rev in `packages/sdk-rs/Cargo.toml` is bumped to the merge commit of the `feat/create-delegation-multi-resource` PR in `tinycloud-node`.

## 2.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- 8abfb4e: Bump past stale `2.1.0-beta.0` / `1.7.2-beta.0` ghost versions to publish PR #184's capability-chain delegation code.

  The earlier `2.1.0-beta.0` (TS SDKs) and `1.7.2-beta.0` (WASM) tarballs on npm predate PR #184 and are missing `resolveManifest`, `isCapabilitySubset`, manifest types, and the `parseRecapFromSiwe` re-export. This empty changeset forces `changeset version` to land on the next beta counter so the Beta Release workflow actually publishes the post-#184 code.

  All four TS packages in the linked group are named explicitly so `@tinycloud/sdk-services` advances too (naming only `@tinycloud/sdk-core` left it pinned at the ghost `2.1.0-beta.0`). Both WASM wrappers take a patch bump so the TS SDKs don't pin a stale `@tinycloud/*-sdk-wasm@1.7.2-beta.0`.

  - **WASM rev bump (previously merged without a changeset)**: `@tinycloud/sdk-rs` now tracks a tinycloud-node revision that accepts `nonce` in `SessionConfig`. Before this rev, `siweConfig.nonce` was forwarded by the TypeScript layer but silently dropped inside the Rust WASM layer. Single-signature auth flows that rely on server-provided nonces (e.g. billing sidecars) now work end-to-end.
  - **New top-level `nonce` field**: Callers can now pass `nonce` directly on `ClientConfig` / `TinyCloudNodeConfig` instead of nesting it under `siweConfig`. Precedence is `siweConfig.nonce` > top-level `nonce` > random (generated by the WASM layer), so `siweConfig.nonce` still wins when both are set. Omitting both preserves existing behavior.

  external service (e.g. billing sidecar) provides a nonce for verification.

  - `connectSigner()` method for injecting any ISigner
  - `@tinycloud/node-sdk/core` entry point (zero Node WASM deps, for browser bundlers)
  - `restoreSession()` now initializes Vault

  New in sdk-core:
  - `INotificationHandler`, `IENSResolver`, `IWasmBindings`, `ISessionManager` interfaces
  - `ClientSession`, `SiweConfig`, `EnsData` types (moved from web-core)

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a2b4b66: Breaking API changes for node-sdk delegation system

  ### node-sdk

  **BREAKING: `allowSubDelegation` → `disableSubDelegation`**
  - Sub-delegation is now allowed by default (aligns with ocap/UCAN expectations)
  - Use `disableSubDelegation: true` to prevent recipients from creating sub-delegations
  - Before: `createDelegation({ allowSubDelegation: true })` to enable
  - After: `createDelegation({})` enables by default, use `disableSubDelegation: true` to disable

  **BREAKING: `autoCreateNamespace` default changed to `false`**
  - Namespaces are no longer auto-created during sign-in
  - Use `autoCreateNamespace: true` explicitly for namespace owners
  - Delegates using shared namespaces should not set this flag

  ### web-sdk
  - Fixed `KVServiceAdapter` to include `jwk` property required by `ServiceSession`

### Patch Changes

- a2b4b66: Create node-sdk package with Node.js-specific TinyCloud SDK implementations.

  This package provides:
  - `PrivateKeySigner`: ISigner implementation using private keys via WASM
  - `NodeUserAuthorization`: IUserAuthorization with configurable sign strategies
    - auto-sign: Automatically approve all sign requests
    - auto-reject: Reject all sign requests
    - callback: Delegate to custom callback function
    - event-emitter: Emit sign requests as events
  - `MemorySessionStorage`: In-memory ISessionStorage
  - `FileSessionStorage`: File-based ISessionStorage for session persistence

  Part of TC-401: IUserAuthorization shared interface implementation.

- a2b4b66: Fix delegation chain support for user-to-user delegations
  - Added `pkhDid` getter for PKH DID format (`did:pkh:eip155:{chainId}:{address}`)
  - Fixed `createDelegation` to use `delegateUri` for targeting recipient's PKH DID
  - Fixed `createSubDelegation` to use `delegateUri` instead of generating random JWK
  - Fixed sub-delegation expiry to cap at parent's expiry instead of throwing error
  - Updated demo to use `pkhDid` for all delegations

  Full delegation chain now works: Alice → Bob → Charlie
